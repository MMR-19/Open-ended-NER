Example #1: Since the Google acquisition, the company has notched up a number of significant achievements, perhaps the most notable being the creation of AlphaGo, a program that defeated world champion Lee Sedol at the complex game of Go.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Google', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'AlphaGo', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Lee Sedol', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Go', 'entity': 'Misc}]'

Example #2: In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'support-vector machines', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'SVMs', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'support-vector networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'supervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'classification', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'regression analysis', 'entity': 'Task}]'
