Example #8: The hero is presented devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human, though heroic, as he is forever trying to pull Paris's arrow from his heel.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #9: For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Kiev', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'mutton or lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'Poltava', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'goose', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #10: HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact, and research indicates that there is no risk of HIV transmission via frot.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'HIV', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #11: The colonists enjoyed butter in cooking as well, but it was rare prior to the American Revolution, as cattle were not yet plentiful.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'butter', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'American Revolution', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'cattle', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #12: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #13: The satellite " Explorer 1 " was in mass.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Explorer 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #14: 58 rifles to stand in for AK-47 s because they were cheaper than prop guns.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AK-47', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #15: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #16: The inhabitants paid for their punishment by wandering underwater, their desperate scream being transmitted by Oźwiena, the goddess of echo.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Oźwiena', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'World War III', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'sterile', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #18: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #19: The transmission is the eight-speed ZF 8HP automatic transmission.
