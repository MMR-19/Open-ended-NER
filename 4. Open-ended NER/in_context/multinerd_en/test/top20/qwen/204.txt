Example #9: " Streptomyces achromogenes " is a species of gram-positive bacterium that belongs in the genus " Streptomyces ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptomyces', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Sulforaphane, a glucosinolate breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'broccoli', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'prostate cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #11: The algae is sometimes identified as " Cladophora " sp. or " Dichotomosiphon tuberosus ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladophora', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #12: The transmission is the eight-speed ZF 8HP automatic transmission.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ZF 8HP', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #13: " M. hominis " causes " male sterility / Genitals inflammation " in humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'M. hominis', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'male sterility', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #14: In 1959 he founded the De Tomaso car company in Modena, originally to build prototypes and racing cars, including a Formula One car for Frank Williams ' team in 1970.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'De Tomaso', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Modena', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Formula One', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Frank Williams', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #15: In 1959 he founded the De Tomaso car company in Modena, originally to build prototypes and racing cars, including a Formula One car for Frank Williams ' team in 1970.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'De Tomaso', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Modena', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Formula One', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Frank Williams', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #16: The vehicle has the long-hood short-deck design common to the Z-Car family.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Z-Car', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #17: In the case of " Plasmodium ", merozoites infect red blood cells and then rapidly reproduce asexually.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #18: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
