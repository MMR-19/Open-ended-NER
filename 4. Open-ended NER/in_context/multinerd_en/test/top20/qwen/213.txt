Example #7: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: Strains of " Escherichia coli " and " Vibrio cholerae " lacking Hsp33 were rendered especially sensitive to HOCl.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact, and research indicates that there is no risk of HIV transmission via frot.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'HIV', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #11: " Plasmodium " parasites including " Haemoproteus " have been detected in their blood.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Haemoproteus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #12: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #13: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #14: are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by " Salmonella " spp., " Shigella " spp.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Shigella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #15: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #16: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #17: Sulforaphane, a glucosinolate breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'broccoli', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'prostate cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #18: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #19: " Aspergillus " and other moulds play an important role in these consortia because they are adept at recycling starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #20: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
