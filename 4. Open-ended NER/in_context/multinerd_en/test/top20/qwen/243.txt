Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'M. hominis', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'male sterility', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #11: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #12: (meat waiters) come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are speared various kinds of meat, be it beef, pork, filet mignon, lamb, chicken, duck, ham (with pineapple), sausage, fish, or any other sort of local cut of meat.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'beef', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pork', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'filet mignon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chicken', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'duck', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'ham', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sausage', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #13: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #14: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #15: The genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from " Agrobacterium ", with genes actively expressed by the plants.

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'HIV', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #17: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
