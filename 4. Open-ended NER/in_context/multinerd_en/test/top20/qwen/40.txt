Example #10: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #11: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #12: The genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from " Agrobacterium ", with genes actively expressed by the plants.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Agrobacterium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #13: are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by " Salmonella " spp., " Shigella " spp.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Shigella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #14: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #15: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
