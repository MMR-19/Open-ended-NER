Example #11: His " " Monoplane " " was a large aircraft made of aluminium, with a wingspan of and a weight of only without the pilot.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Monoplane', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #12: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #13: Two aircraft were re-engined with a 320 " hp (239 " kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ABC Dragonfly', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Sopwith Dragon', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #14: Two aircraft were re-engined with a 320 " hp (239 " kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon.
