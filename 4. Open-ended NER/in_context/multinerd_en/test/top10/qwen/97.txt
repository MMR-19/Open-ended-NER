Example #1: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: " M. hominis " causes " male sterility / Genitals inflammation " in humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'M. hominis', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'male sterility', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #3: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #5: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #6: are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by " Salmonella " spp., " Shigella " spp.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Shigella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: For dietary restrictions, such as those due to allergies and ingredient sensitivity, vegan, gluten free, and dairy free variations are available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegan', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'gluten free', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dairy free', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #10: " Plasmodium " parasites including " Haemoproteus " have been detected in their blood.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Haemoproteus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
