Example #1: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: The transmission is the eight-speed ZF 8HP automatic transmission.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ZF 8HP', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: The museum also has a Tupolev Tu-144 on display " – this is the only place where both supersonic airliners can be seen together.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tupolev Tu-144', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #4: The symbol for 2 Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2 Pallas', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Pallas Athena', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Franz Xaver von Zach', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Mars', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: This process accelerated in 1977 with the introduction of the first commodity-like microcomputer, the Apple II.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Apple II', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #6: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #7: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #8: While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14 – 15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'V-J Day', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'New York City Department of Sanitation', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #9: While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14 – 15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'V-J Day', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'New York City Department of Sanitation', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #10: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'
