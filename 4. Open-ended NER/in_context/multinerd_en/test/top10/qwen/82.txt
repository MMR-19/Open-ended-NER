Example #1: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Strains of " Escherichia coli " and " Vibrio cholerae " lacking Hsp33 were rendered especially sensitive to HOCl.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: " Streptomyces achromogenes " is a species of gram-positive bacterium that belongs in the genus " Streptomyces ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptomyces', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: Other bacterial species such as " Nitrobacter ", are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrite into nitrate.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nitrobacter', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: A similar pattern was found in " Streptococcus pneumoniae " when 44 strains were sequenced (see figure).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Posaconazole is used to treat invasive " Aspergillus " and " Candida " and fungal infections caused by " Scedosporium " and " Fusarium " species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Candida', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Scedosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #9: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #10: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
