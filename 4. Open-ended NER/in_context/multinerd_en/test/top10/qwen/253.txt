Example #1: Strains of " Escherichia coli " and " Vibrio cholerae " lacking Hsp33 were rendered especially sensitive to HOCl.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: A similar pattern was found in " Streptococcus pneumoniae " when 44 strains were sequenced (see figure).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: " M. hominis " causes " male sterility / Genitals inflammation " in humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'M. hominis', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'male sterility', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #9: HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact, and research indicates that there is no risk of HIV transmission via frot.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'HIV', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: The algae is sometimes identified as " Cladophora " sp. or " Dichotomosiphon tuberosus ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladophora', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
