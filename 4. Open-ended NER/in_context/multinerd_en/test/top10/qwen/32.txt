Example #1: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #2: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: Posaconazole is used to treat invasive " Aspergillus " and " Candida " and fungal infections caused by " Scedosporium " and " Fusarium " species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Candida', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Scedosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: The hyphae of the common mold (" Rhizopus ") are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: " M. hominis " causes " male sterility / Genitals inflammation " in humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'M. hominis', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'male sterility', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #9: " Aspergillus " and other moulds play an important role in these consortia because they are adept at recycling starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: The algae is sometimes identified as " Cladophora " sp. or " Dichotomosiphon tuberosus ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladophora', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
