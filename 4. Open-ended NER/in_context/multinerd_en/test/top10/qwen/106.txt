Example #1: In the case of " Plasmodium ", merozoites infect red blood cells and then rapidly reproduce asexually.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: " Plasmodium " parasites including " Haemoproteus " have been detected in their blood.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Haemoproteus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: Posaconazole is used to treat invasive " Aspergillus " and " Candida " and fungal infections caused by " Scedosporium " and " Fusarium " species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Candida', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Scedosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #6: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #7: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: " M. hominis " causes " male sterility / Genitals inflammation " in humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'M. hominis', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'male sterility', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #10: are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by " Salmonella " spp., " Shigella " spp.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Shigella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
