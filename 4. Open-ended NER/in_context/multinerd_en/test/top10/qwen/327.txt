Example #1: The hyphae of the common mold (" Rhizopus ") are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: " Aspergillus " and other moulds play an important role in these consortia because they are adept at recycling starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: Posaconazole is used to treat invasive " Aspergillus " and " Candida " and fungal infections caused by " Scedosporium " and " Fusarium " species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Candida', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Scedosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: In the case of " Plasmodium ", merozoites infect red blood cells and then rapidly reproduce asexually.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: The algae is sometimes identified as " Cladophora " sp. or " Dichotomosiphon tuberosus ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladophora', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: " Tunicatispora " is a genus of fungi in the family Halosphaeriaceae.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Halosphaeriaceae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Other bacterial species such as " Nitrobacter ", are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrite into nitrate.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nitrobacter', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
