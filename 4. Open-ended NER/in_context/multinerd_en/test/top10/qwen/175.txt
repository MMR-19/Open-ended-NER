Example #3: He was born in Brussels, Belgium, the youngest child of Henry L'Estrange Styleman Le Strange of Hunstanton, Norfolk, educated at Clifton College and died in Cambridge.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Brussels', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Belgium', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': "Henry L'Estrange Styleman Le Strange", 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hunstanton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Norfolk', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Clifton College', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Cambridge', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #4: He caused controversy in 1988 by what Nicholas Kenyon called " plans to create a high level conservatory … for soloists on the model of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia ", cutting the academy's total number of students.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nicholas Kenyon', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Curtis Institute', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Philadelphia', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: Nevertheless, he was encouraged to begin work (1869) on a major choral work, " Les Béatitudes ", which was to occupy him for more than ten years, the delay partly due to the interruptions of the Franco-Prussian War.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Les Béatitudes', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Franco-Prussian War', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #6: In Denmark, " gløgg " pairings typically include æbleskiver sprinkled with powdered sugar and accompanied with strawberry marmalade.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Denmark', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'æbleskiver', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'powdered sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'strawberry', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'marmalade', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #7: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: The Age of Enlightenment, the subsequent French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Age of Enlightenment', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'French Revolution', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Napoleonic Wars', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rh disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Lepidoptera', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #10: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
