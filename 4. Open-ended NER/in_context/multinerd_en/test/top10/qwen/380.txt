Example #1: In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venera 9', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was " MESSENGER ", a probe to the planet Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MESSENGER', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was " MESSENGER ", a probe to the planet Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MESSENGER', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #5: as well as the " Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter " and " MAVEN ", were healthy after the Comet Siding Spring flyby.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'MAVEN', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Comet Siding Spring', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #8: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #9: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #10: The symbol for 2 Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2 Pallas', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Pallas Athena', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Franz Xaver von Zach', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Mars', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
