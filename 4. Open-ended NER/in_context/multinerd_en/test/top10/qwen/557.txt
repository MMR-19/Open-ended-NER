Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #4: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Astronomical Almanac', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: It is also associated with the monster Hydra, with its many heads, killed by Hercules, represented in another constellation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hydra', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Hercules', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'another constellation', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
