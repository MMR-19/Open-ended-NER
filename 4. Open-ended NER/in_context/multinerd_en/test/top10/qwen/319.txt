Example #1: White fir is popular as a Christmas tree and for Christmas decoration owing to its soft needles, generally excellent needle retention and abundance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Christmas tree', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Christmas', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #2: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: This phytopathogenic bacterium can cause disease in trees like " Prunus ", hazelnut and walnut.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'phytopathogenic', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Prunus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'hazelnut', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'walnut', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #4: Sulforaphane, a glucosinolate breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'broccoli', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'prostate cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #5: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Ripe fruits and fruit parts including blackthorn (sloe berries), " Aronia " chokeberry, chokecherry, bird cherry, rhubarb, quince and persimmon fruits, and banana skins are very astringent; citrus fruits, like lemons, are somewhat astringent.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aronia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'rhubarb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'quince', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'persimmon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'banana', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #7: The colonists enjoyed butter in cooking as well, but it was rare prior to the American Revolution, as cattle were not yet plentiful.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'butter', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'American Revolution', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'cattle', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #8: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: While the region is best known for its convict history it is now the key area in the battle to save the Tasmanian devil from extinction from a new type of contagious cancer called devil facial tumour disease (DFTD).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tasmanian devil', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'contagious cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'devil facial tumour disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'
