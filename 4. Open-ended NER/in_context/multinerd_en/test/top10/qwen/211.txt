Example #1: In 1976, " Luna 24 " landed several hundred meters away and successfully returned samples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 24', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #2: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venera 9', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #6: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #8: In antiquity it was a place of worship, because it was believed to be the cave where the titan Rhea hid the infant Zeus, to protect him from his father Cronus who intended to swallow him like others of his progeny.

Example #9: On February 3, 1966 " Luna 9 " spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 9', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'lunar', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: On February 3, 1966 " Luna 9 " spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 9', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'lunar', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
