Example #1: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #2: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #5: Traditional dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains, as opposed to a western pattern diet characterized by processed foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer were associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia (mood disorder) and for anxiety disorders in women.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegetables', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fruit', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'meat', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'whole grains', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'western pattern diet', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'processed foods', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'beer', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dysthymia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'anxiety disorders', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #6: The Age of Enlightenment, the subsequent French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Age of Enlightenment', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'French Revolution', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Napoleonic Wars', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #7: While the region is best known for its convict history it is now the key area in the battle to save the Tasmanian devil from extinction from a new type of contagious cancer called devil facial tumour disease (DFTD).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tasmanian devil', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'contagious cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'devil facial tumour disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #8: White fir is popular as a Christmas tree and for Christmas decoration owing to its soft needles, generally excellent needle retention and abundance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Christmas tree', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Christmas', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #9: The park's elevation and dry desert air, along with the relatively stable atmosphere in the region, often make for excellent seeing conditions.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'dry', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'relatively stable', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #10: Globotruncanid Foraminifera and echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish (sea stars) thrived.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Foraminifera', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
