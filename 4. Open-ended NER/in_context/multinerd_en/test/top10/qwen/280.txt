Example #1: In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venera 9', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: as well as the " Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter " and " MAVEN ", were healthy after the Comet Siding Spring flyby.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'MAVEN', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Comet Siding Spring', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: In 1976, " Luna 24 " landed several hundred meters away and successfully returned samples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 24', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #5: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #6: The algae is sometimes identified as " Cladophora " sp. or " Dichotomosiphon tuberosus ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladophora', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the " Voyager 1 " space probe taken on March 5, 1979, while making its flyby of Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Stephen P. Synnott', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Voyager 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was " MESSENGER ", a probe to the planet Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MESSENGER', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was " MESSENGER ", a probe to the planet Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MESSENGER', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'
