Example #1: In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venera 9', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #3: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #4: In 1976, " Luna 24 " landed several hundred meters away and successfully returned samples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 24', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #5: The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the " Voyager 1 " space probe taken on March 5, 1979, while making its flyby of Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Stephen P. Synnott', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Voyager 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: Her mother Ceres, also known as Demeter, the goddess of agriculture or of the Earth, went looking for her across all of the world, and all in vain.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ceres', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Demeter', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was " MESSENGER ", a probe to the planet Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MESSENGER', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was " MESSENGER ", a probe to the planet Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MESSENGER', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
