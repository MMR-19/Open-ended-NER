Example #3: Both were then downed by AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AIM-9 Sidewinder', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #4: This required extensive modifications to add a large radar to the nose of the aircraft, a second crew member to operate it, and a new weapons bay using a rotating door that kept its four AIM-4 Falcon missiles or two AIR-2 Genie rockets hidden within the airframe until it was time to be fired.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AIM-4 Falcon', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'AIR-2 Genie', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #5: This required extensive modifications to add a large radar to the nose of the aircraft, a second crew member to operate it, and a new weapons bay using a rotating door that kept its four AIM-4 Falcon missiles or two AIR-2 Genie rockets hidden within the airframe until it was time to be fired.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AIM-4 Falcon', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'AIR-2 Genie', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #6: The 330's design was refined and heavily modified, resulting in the Short 360.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Short 360', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'
