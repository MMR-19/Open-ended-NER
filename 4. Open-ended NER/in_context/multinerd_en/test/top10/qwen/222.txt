Example #1: The satellite " Explorer 1 " was in mass.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Explorer 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #2: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: as well as the " Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter " and " MAVEN ", were healthy after the Comet Siding Spring flyby.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'MAVEN', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Comet Siding Spring', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'European Space Agency', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Olympus-1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'meteoroid', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: On February 3, 1966 " Luna 9 " spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 9', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'lunar', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: On February 3, 1966 " Luna 9 " spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 9', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'lunar', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: For instance, the " Astronomical Almanac " for 2010 lists the apparent geocentric position of the Moon on January 1 at 00:00:00.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Astronomical Almanac', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
