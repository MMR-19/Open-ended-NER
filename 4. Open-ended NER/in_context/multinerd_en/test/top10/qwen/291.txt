Example #1: as well as the " Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter " and " MAVEN ", were healthy after the Comet Siding Spring flyby.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'MAVEN', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Comet Siding Spring', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #4: In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venera 9', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: In 1976, " Luna 24 " landed several hundred meters away and successfully returned samples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 24', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #6: Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was " MESSENGER ", a probe to the planet Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MESSENGER', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was " MESSENGER ", a probe to the planet Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MESSENGER', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'European Space Agency', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Olympus-1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'meteoroid', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: The transmission is the eight-speed ZF 8HP automatic transmission.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ZF 8HP', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #10: The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
