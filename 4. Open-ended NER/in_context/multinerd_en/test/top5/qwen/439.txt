Example #1: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #2: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: The park's elevation and dry desert air, along with the relatively stable atmosphere in the region, often make for excellent seeing conditions.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'dry', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'relatively stable', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #4: Following the Civil War, Reconstruction Era economic expansion led to an increase in logging and deforestation, especially in the southern Adirondacks.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Civil War', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Reconstruction Era', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'Adirondacks', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: While the region is best known for its convict history it is now the key area in the battle to save the Tasmanian devil from extinction from a new type of contagious cancer called devil facial tumour disease (DFTD).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tasmanian devil', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'contagious cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'devil facial tumour disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'
