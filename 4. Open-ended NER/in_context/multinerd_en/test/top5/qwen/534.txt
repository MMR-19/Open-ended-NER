Example #1: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #2: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: For instance, the " Astronomical Almanac " for 2010 lists the apparent geocentric position of the Moon on January 1 at 00:00:00.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Astronomical Almanac', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: Following the Civil War, Reconstruction Era economic expansion led to an increase in logging and deforestation, especially in the southern Adirondacks.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Civil War', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Reconstruction Era', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'Adirondacks', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: The second monumental sector was attributed to the god Anu by the excavators of the site, because it was the location of a sanctuary for this god some 3000 years later.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Anu', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'
