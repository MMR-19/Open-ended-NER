Example #1: In 1976, " Luna 24 " landed several hundred meters away and successfully returned samples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 24', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #2: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #4: The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: Variants of the 747 remained the largest airliners flying for well over thirty years, some with a " stretched " upper deck, until the arrival of the Airbus A380 series in 2007 featuring a full-length upper deck.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Airbus A380', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'
