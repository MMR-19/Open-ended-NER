Example #1: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #4: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the " Voyager 1 " space probe taken on March 5, 1979, while making its flyby of Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Stephen P. Synnott', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Voyager 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
