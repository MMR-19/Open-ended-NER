Example #1: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #2: The satellite " Explorer 1 " was in mass.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Explorer 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: The algae is sometimes identified as " Cladophora " sp. or " Dichotomosiphon tuberosus ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladophora', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
