Example #1: The park's elevation and dry desert air, along with the relatively stable atmosphere in the region, often make for excellent seeing conditions.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'dry', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'relatively stable', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #2: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: The vehicle has the long-hood short-deck design common to the Z-Car family.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Z-Car', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #4: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
