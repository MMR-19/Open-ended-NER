Example #1: This process accelerated in 1977 with the introduction of the first commodity-like microcomputer, the Apple II.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Apple II', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #2: In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venera 9', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: The satellite " Explorer 1 " was in mass.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Explorer 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #4: The first artificial object to reach another celestial body was Luna 2 reaching the Moon in 1959.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'
