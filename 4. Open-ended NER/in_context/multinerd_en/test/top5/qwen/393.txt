Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #4: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.

Example #5: This is the fertilized eggs or roe (" qaarsat, meluk, imlauk ") of the Pacific herring attached to eelgrass, seaweed or other submerged vegetation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'roe', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'Pacific herring', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'eelgrass', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'
