Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'wet season', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: He was named in midfield alongside Barry Moran, for the FBD League fixture against IT Sligo.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Barry Moran', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'FBD League', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'IT Sligo', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #4: He caused controversy in 1988 by what Nicholas Kenyon called " plans to create a high level conservatory … for soloists on the model of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia ", cutting the academy's total number of students.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nicholas Kenyon', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Curtis Institute', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Philadelphia', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: Menu items that are generally considered breakfast foods are served in the school's dining hall late at night (hence " midnight ") as a study break before or during final exams, or as a traditional community-building event.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'breakfast', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
