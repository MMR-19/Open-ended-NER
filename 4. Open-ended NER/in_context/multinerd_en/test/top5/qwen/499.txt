Example #1: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #2: For dietary restrictions, such as those due to allergies and ingredient sensitivity, vegan, gluten free, and dairy free variations are available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegan', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'gluten free', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dairy free', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #3: In 1975 the Venera 9 was the first to return images from the surface of another planet, returning images from Venus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venera 9', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
