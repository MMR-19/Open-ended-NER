Example #1: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #2: The satellite " Explorer 1 " was in mass.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Explorer 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #5: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
