Example #3: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #4: For dietary restrictions, such as those due to allergies and ingredient sensitivity, vegan, gluten free, and dairy free variations are available.

Example #5: The film retained the No. 1 spot over the three-day weekend and grossed $ 40.5 million, which is the third-highest Easter debut ever behind " Furious 7 " and " Clash of the Titans ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Easter', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'Furious 7', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Clash of the Titans', 'entity': 'Media'}]'
