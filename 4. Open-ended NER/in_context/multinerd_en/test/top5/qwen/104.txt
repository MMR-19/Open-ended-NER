Example #1: Variants of the 747 remained the largest airliners flying for well over thirty years, some with a " stretched " upper deck, until the arrival of the Airbus A380 series in 2007 featuring a full-length upper deck.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Airbus A380', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #2: The museum also has a Tupolev Tu-144 on display " – this is the only place where both supersonic airliners can be seen together.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tupolev Tu-144', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #3: This required extensive modifications to add a large radar to the nose of the aircraft, a second crew member to operate it, and a new weapons bay using a rotating door that kept its four AIM-4 Falcon missiles or two AIR-2 Genie rockets hidden within the airframe until it was time to be fired.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AIM-4 Falcon', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'AIR-2 Genie', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #4: This required extensive modifications to add a large radar to the nose of the aircraft, a second crew member to operate it, and a new weapons bay using a rotating door that kept its four AIM-4 Falcon missiles or two AIR-2 Genie rockets hidden within the airframe until it was time to be fired.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AIM-4 Falcon', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'AIR-2 Genie', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #5: This aircraft would replace the Fairey Fulmar, which had been viewed as an interim design.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fairey Fulmar', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'
