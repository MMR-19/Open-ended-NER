Example #1: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: The Voyager Golden Record is attached to one of the bus sides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voyager Golden Record', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #5: It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the " Voyager 1 " space probe taken on March 5, 1979, while making its flyby of Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Stephen P. Synnott', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Voyager 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
