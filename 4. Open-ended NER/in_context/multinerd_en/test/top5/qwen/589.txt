Example #1: Globotruncanid Foraminifera and echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish (sea stars) thrived.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Foraminifera', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: World War I saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed " shell shock ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'World War I', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'shell shock', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #4: World War I saw a massive increase of conditions that came to be termed " shell shock ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'World War I', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'shell shock', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #5: Traditionally, the winner of the men's heavyweight class will go on to compete in major national and international strongman contests such as the World's Strongest Man and the Arnold Strongman Classic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "World's Strongest Man", 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Arnold Strongman Classic', 'entity': 'Event'}]'
