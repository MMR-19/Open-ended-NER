Example #1: Two aircraft were re-engined with a 320 " hp (239 " kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ABC Dragonfly', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Sopwith Dragon', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #2: Two aircraft were re-engined with a 320 " hp (239 " kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ABC Dragonfly', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Sopwith Dragon', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #3: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #4: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #5: It was powered by two Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engines with side-mounted intakes high on the fuselage (above the wingroot).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lyulka AL-7', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'
