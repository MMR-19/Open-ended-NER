Example #1: The park's elevation and dry desert air, along with the relatively stable atmosphere in the region, often make for excellent seeing conditions.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'dry', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'relatively stable', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #2: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #3: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #4: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: For dietary restrictions, such as those due to allergies and ingredient sensitivity, vegan, gluten free, and dairy free variations are available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegan', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'gluten free', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dairy free', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'
