Example #1: The hyphae of the common mold (" Rhizopus ") are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Posaconazole is used to treat invasive " Aspergillus " and " Candida " and fungal infections caused by " Scedosporium " and " Fusarium " species, which may occur in immunocompromised patients.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Candida', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Scedosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: This is unlike the original cartoon, which featured other stories such as " Tom Slick " and " Super Chicken ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tom Slick', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Super Chicken', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #4: " Aspergillus " and other moulds play an important role in these consortia because they are adept at recycling starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Born in Lucerne, the third of eight siblings, to a cabin cruiser engineer, he studied art at the Académie Julian in Paris and later in Berlin, and admired artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lucerne', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Académie Julian', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Berlin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Pablo Picasso', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Georges Braque', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #6: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #7: " Tunicatispora " is a genus of fungi in the family Halosphaeriaceae.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Halosphaeriaceae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: Both were then downed by AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AIM-9 Sidewinder', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #9: A similar pattern was found in " Streptococcus pneumoniae " when 44 strains were sequenced (see figure).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
