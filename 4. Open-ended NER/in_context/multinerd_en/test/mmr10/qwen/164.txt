Example #1: The hyphae of the common mold (" Rhizopus ") are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: A similar pattern was found in " Streptococcus pneumoniae " when 44 strains were sequenced (see figure).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: While the region is best known for its convict history it is now the key area in the battle to save the Tasmanian devil from extinction from a new type of contagious cancer called devil facial tumour disease (DFTD).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tasmanian devil', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'contagious cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'devil facial tumour disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #4: Globotruncanid Foraminifera and echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish (sea stars) thrived.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Foraminifera', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Erectile dysfunction from vascular disease is usually seen only amongst elderly individuals who have atherosclerosis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'elderly', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'atherosclerosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #6: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: Other bacterial species such as " Nitrobacter ", are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrite into nitrate.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nitrobacter', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact, and research indicates that there is no risk of HIV transmission via frot.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'HIV', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the Fender Precision Bass and Fender Jazz Bass remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010 s.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fender Precision Bass', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Fender Jazz Bass', 'entity': 'Media'}]'
