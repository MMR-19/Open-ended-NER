Example #1: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Strains of " Escherichia coli " and " Vibrio cholerae " lacking Hsp33 were rendered especially sensitive to HOCl.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: " Streptomyces achromogenes " is a species of gram-positive bacterium that belongs in the genus " Streptomyces ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptomyces', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Born in Lucerne, the third of eight siblings, to a cabin cruiser engineer, he studied art at the Académie Julian in Paris and later in Berlin, and admired artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lucerne', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Académie Julian', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Berlin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Pablo Picasso', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Georges Braque', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #6: 58 rifles to stand in for AK-47 s because they were cheaper than prop guns.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AK-47', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #7: The new version was a vertical triband, with red outer bands and a white middle band, with a golden sun representing Inti at the center.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Inti', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #8: A similar pattern was found in " Streptococcus pneumoniae " when 44 strains were sequenced (see figure).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: Chili, scallop with butter, teriyaki, takoyaki, and yakitori chip flavors are also available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chili', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'scallop', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'teriyaki', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'takoyaki', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'yakitori', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #10: The genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from " Agrobacterium ", with genes actively expressed by the plants.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Agrobacterium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
