Example #2: Although originally described by Philippi in 1858 it has long remained buried in other taxa, principally " Hippeastrum " and more recently " Rhodophiala ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Philippi', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hippeastrum', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Rhodophiala', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #3: While the region is best known for its convict history it is now the key area in the battle to save the Tasmanian devil from extinction from a new type of contagious cancer called devil facial tumour disease (DFTD).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tasmanian devil', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'contagious cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'devil facial tumour disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #4: " Sagittaria engelmanniana " occurs in wetlands, predominantly those with acidic water such as " Sphagnum " bogs.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sphagnum', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: The algae is sometimes identified as " Cladophora " sp. or " Dichotomosiphon tuberosus ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladophora', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #8: Designed as a four-seat development of the Bede BD-12, which was, in turn, a two-seat version of the single-seat Bede BD-5, the BD-14 was to feature a cantilever low-wing, a four-seat enclosed cockpit under a gull-wing canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Bede BD-12', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Bede BD-5', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #9: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #10: Ripe fruits and fruit parts including blackthorn (sloe berries), " Aronia " chokeberry, chokecherry, bird cherry, rhubarb, quince and persimmon fruits, and banana skins are very astringent; citrus fruits, like lemons, are somewhat astringent.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aronia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'rhubarb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'quince', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'persimmon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'banana', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'
