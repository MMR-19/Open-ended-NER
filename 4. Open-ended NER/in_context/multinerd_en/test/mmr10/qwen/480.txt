Example #2: " Sagittaria engelmanniana " occurs in wetlands, predominantly those with acidic water such as " Sphagnum " bogs.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sphagnum', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: Although originally described by Philippi in 1858 it has long remained buried in other taxa, principally " Hippeastrum " and more recently " Rhodophiala ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Philippi', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hippeastrum', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Rhodophiala', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #4: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #5: " Plasmodium " parasites including " Haemoproteus " have been detected in their blood.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Haemoproteus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Ripe fruits and fruit parts including blackthorn (sloe berries), " Aronia " chokeberry, chokecherry, bird cherry, rhubarb, quince and persimmon fruits, and banana skins are very astringent; citrus fruits, like lemons, are somewhat astringent.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aronia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'rhubarb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'quince', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'persimmon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'banana', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #7: This is the fertilized eggs or roe (" qaarsat, meluk, imlauk ") of the Pacific herring attached to eelgrass, seaweed or other submerged vegetation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'roe', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'Pacific herring', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'eelgrass', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #8: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: Some recipes also call for small quantities of star anise, asafoetida, chili, stone flower (known as " dagadphool "), and " kababchini " (" cubeb ").
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'asafoetida', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chili', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'stone flower', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #10: White fir is popular as a Christmas tree and for Christmas decoration owing to its soft needles, generally excellent needle retention and abundance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Christmas tree', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Christmas', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
