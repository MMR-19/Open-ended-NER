Example #1: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #2: It was powered by two Lyulka AL-7 turbojet engines with side-mounted intakes high on the fuselage (above the wingroot).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lyulka AL-7', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #3: In 1976, " Luna 24 " landed several hundred meters away and successfully returned samples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 24', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #4: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: The hero is presented devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human, though heroic, as he is forever trying to pull Paris's arrow from his heel.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #6: In Indonesia, a type of traditional ice cream called " es puter " or " stirred ice cream " is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugar - and flavors that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Indonesia', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'pandanus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'avocado', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'jackfruit', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'durian', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'palm sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chocolate', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'red bean', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'mung bean', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'
