Example #1: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Although originally described by Philippi in 1858 it has long remained buried in other taxa, principally " Hippeastrum " and more recently " Rhodophiala ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Philippi', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hippeastrum', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Rhodophiala', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #3: Other agricultural products in general are rice, corn, tea, pork, poultry, beef, fish and other fruits and vegetables.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'rice', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'corn', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'tea', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pork', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'poultry', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'beef', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #4: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: " Plasmodium " parasites including " Haemoproteus " have been detected in their blood.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Haemoproteus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: According to one such tradition, she is the personification of the Earth itself; according to another, its actual mother, being " Prithvi Tattwa ", the essence of the element earth.

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Android', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'

Example #8: Globotruncanid Foraminifera and echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish (sea stars) thrived.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Foraminifera', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: The 330's design was refined and heavily modified, resulting in the Short 360.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Short 360', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #10: An older sister, Susan, is a rabbi who lives in Jerusalem with her husband, Yosef Abramowitz, the co-founder and president of Arava Power Company, and their five children.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Susan', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jerusalem', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Yosef Abramowitz', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Arava Power Company', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'
