Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #4: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: Globotruncanid Foraminifera and echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish (sea stars) thrived.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Foraminifera', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: In Indonesia, a type of traditional ice cream called " es puter " or " stirred ice cream " is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugar - and flavors that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Indonesia', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'pandanus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'avocado', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'jackfruit', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'durian', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'palm sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chocolate', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'red bean', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'mung bean', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #7: " Sagittaria engelmanniana " occurs in wetlands, predominantly those with acidic water such as " Sphagnum " bogs.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sphagnum', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: " Plasmodium " parasites including " Haemoproteus " have been detected in their blood.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Haemoproteus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: The second monumental sector was attributed to the god Anu by the excavators of the site, because it was the location of a sanctuary for this god some 3000 years later.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Anu', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #10: The two films and the holdovers " Jurassic World " and " Inside Out " were each projected to earn $ 45 – 55 million during the Independence Day holiday period and $ 27 – 30 million over the three-day weekend.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jurassic World', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Inside Out', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Independence Day', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
