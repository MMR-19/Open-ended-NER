Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #5: The symbol for 2 Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2 Pallas', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Pallas Athena', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Franz Xaver von Zach', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Mars', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: The film retained the No. 1 spot over the three-day weekend and grossed $ 40.5 million, which is the third-highest Easter debut ever behind " Furious 7 " and " Clash of the Titans ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Easter', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'Furious 7', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Clash of the Titans', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #7: Designed as a four-seat development of the Bede BD-12, which was, in turn, a two-seat version of the single-seat Bede BD-5, the BD-14 was to feature a cantilever low-wing, a four-seat enclosed cockpit under a gull-wing canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Bede BD-12', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Bede BD-5', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #8: White fir is popular as a Christmas tree and for Christmas decoration owing to its soft needles, generally excellent needle retention and abundance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Christmas tree', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Christmas', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #9: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: The War of the Spanish Succession lasted 11 years, and ended when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1714.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'War of the Spanish Succession', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Treaty of Utrecht', 'entity': 'Media'}]'
