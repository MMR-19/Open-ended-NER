Example #1: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Traditional dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains, as opposed to a western pattern diet characterized by processed foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer were associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia (mood disorder) and for anxiety disorders in women.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegetables', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fruit', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'meat', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'whole grains', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'western pattern diet', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'processed foods', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'beer', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dysthymia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'anxiety disorders', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #3: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #4: These can include those of advanced age, patients bed-bound in a hospital, individuals with certain types of physical or mental disability, and people working in extreme conditions, such as astronauts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'those of advanced age', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'mental', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'disability', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #5: It began approximately in the mid-18 th century and depending on the author either ended with the beginning of contemporary history after World War II, or includes that period up to the present day.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'contemporary history', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #6: Menu items that are generally considered breakfast foods are served in the school's dining hall late at night (hence " midnight ") as a study break before or during final exams, or as a traditional community-building event.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'breakfast', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #7: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #8: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: It contains slices of cooked buffalo or cow lips, " bangkuang, " unripe mango, pineapple, cucumber, " kangkung ", lontong (rice cake), tofu and tempe, all served in a black sauce made from " petis " (black fermented prawn paste, related to terasi) and crushed peanuts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'buffalo', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'mango', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'cucumber', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'kangkung', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lontong', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'rice cake', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'tofu', 'entity': 'Food'}]'
