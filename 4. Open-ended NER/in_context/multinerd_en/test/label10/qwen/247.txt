Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AIM-4 Falcon', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'AIR-2 Genie', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #8: This required extensive modifications to add a large radar to the nose of the aircraft, a second crew member to operate it, and a new weapons bay using a rotating door that kept its four AIM-4 Falcon missiles or two AIR-2 Genie rockets hidden within the airframe until it was time to be fired.
