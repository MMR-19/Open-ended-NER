Example #1: Sulforaphane, a glucosinolate breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'broccoli', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'prostate cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #2: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: Traditionally, the winner of the men's heavyweight class will go on to compete in major national and international strongman contests such as the World's Strongest Man and the Arnold Strongman Classic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "World's Strongest Man", 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Arnold Strongman Classic', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #4: Menu items that are generally considered breakfast foods are served in the school's dining hall late at night (hence " midnight ") as a study break before or during final exams, or as a traditional community-building event.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'breakfast', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #5: For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Kiev', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'mutton or lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'Poltava', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'goose', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #6: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #10: Over the course of the Middle Kingdom, however, he was displaced in that role by Amun, who may have arisen elsewhere.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Middle Kingdom', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'Amun', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'
