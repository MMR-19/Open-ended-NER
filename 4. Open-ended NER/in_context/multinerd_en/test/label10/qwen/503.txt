Example #1: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.

Example #2: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.

Example #3: Designed as a four-seat development of the Bede BD-12, which was, in turn, a two-seat version of the single-seat Bede BD-5, the BD-14 was to feature a cantilever low-wing, a four-seat enclosed cockpit under a gull-wing canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Bede BD-12', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Bede BD-5', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #4: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #6: as well as the " Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter " and " MAVEN ", were healthy after the Comet Siding Spring flyby.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'MAVEN', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Comet Siding Spring', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period, but language revitalisation efforts have been underway since the 19th century.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Egyptian Arabic', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'early modern period', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #8: Hanns Bruno Geinitz described " Kreischeria wiedei " from the coal measures of Zwickau in Germany, although he interpreted it as a fossil pseudoscorpion.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hanns Bruno Geinitz', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Zwickau', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Germany', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'pseudoscorpion', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #9: It began approximately in the mid-18 th century and depending on the author either ended with the beginning of contemporary history after World War II, or includes that period up to the present day.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'contemporary history', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #10: Its design was modified to a military transport as the Tupolev Tu-75, but this was also not placed into production.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tupolev Tu-75', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'
