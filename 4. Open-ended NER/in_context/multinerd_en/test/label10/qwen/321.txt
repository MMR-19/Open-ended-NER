Example #1: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #2: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: (meat waiters) come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are speared various kinds of meat, be it beef, pork, filet mignon, lamb, chicken, duck, ham (with pineapple), sausage, fish, or any other sort of local cut of meat.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'beef', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pork', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'filet mignon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chicken', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'duck', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'ham', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sausage', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #4: Traditional dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains, as opposed to a western pattern diet characterized by processed foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer were associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia (mood disorder) and for anxiety disorders in women.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegetables', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fruit', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'meat', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'whole grains', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'western pattern diet', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'processed foods', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'beer', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dysthymia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'anxiety disorders', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #5: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #6: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #7: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #8: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #9: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
