Example #1: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: Howard Goodall (subsequently composer of the theme music for " Blackadder ", " Red Dwarf ", and " The Vicar of Dibley ") was musical director.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Howard Goodall', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Blackadder', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Red Dwarf', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'The Vicar of Dibley', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #4: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #7: In finance, " default " is failure to meet the legal obligations (or conditions) of a loan, for example when a home buyer fails to make a mortgage payment, or when a corporation or government fails to pay a bond which has reached maturity.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'legal obligations (or conditions)', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'maturity', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #8: Ripe fruits and fruit parts including blackthorn (sloe berries), " Aronia " chokeberry, chokecherry, bird cherry, rhubarb, quince and persimmon fruits, and banana skins are very astringent; citrus fruits, like lemons, are somewhat astringent.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aronia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'rhubarb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'quince', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'persimmon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'banana', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #9: This is the fertilized eggs or roe (" qaarsat, meluk, imlauk ") of the Pacific herring attached to eelgrass, seaweed or other submerged vegetation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'roe', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'Pacific herring', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'eelgrass', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #10: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
