Example #1: HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact, and research indicates that there is no risk of HIV transmission via frot.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'HIV', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: Reissued versions of vintage instruments such as the Fender Precision Bass and Fender Jazz Bass remained popular among new instrument buyers up to the 2010 s.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fender Precision Bass', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Fender Jazz Bass', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #4: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #6: He finished the season with 16 appearances among Serie A, Europa League and Coppa Italia.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Serie A', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Europa League', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Coppa Italia', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #7: For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Kiev', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'mutton or lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'Poltava', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'goose', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #8: This is unlike the original cartoon, which featured other stories such as " Tom Slick " and " Super Chicken ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tom Slick', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Super Chicken', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #9: Sulforaphane, a glucosinolate breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'broccoli', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'prostate cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #10: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
