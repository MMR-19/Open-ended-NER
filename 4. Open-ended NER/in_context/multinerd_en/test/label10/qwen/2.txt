Example #6: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: He was honoured for his pioneering work on prevention of Rh disease of the newborn, and also for his work on the genetics of the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rh disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Lepidoptera', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #8: (meat waiters) come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are speared various kinds of meat, be it beef, pork, filet mignon, lamb, chicken, duck, ham (with pineapple), sausage, fish, or any other sort of local cut of meat.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'beef', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pork', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'filet mignon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chicken', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'duck', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'ham', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sausage', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #9: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #10: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'
