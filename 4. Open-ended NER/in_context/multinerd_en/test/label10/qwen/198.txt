Example #1: Traditional dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains, as opposed to a western pattern diet characterized by processed foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer were associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia (mood disorder) and for anxiety disorders in women.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegetables', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fruit', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'meat', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'whole grains', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'western pattern diet', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'processed foods', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'beer', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dysthymia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'anxiety disorders', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #2: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #6: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: She worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Gulf War', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Gulf War syndrome', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #8: HIV is among the infections that require such direct contact, and research indicates that there is no risk of HIV transmission via frot.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'HIV', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
