Example #1: Designed as a four-seat development of the Bede BD-12, which was, in turn, a two-seat version of the single-seat Bede BD-5, the BD-14 was to feature a cantilever low-wing, a four-seat enclosed cockpit under a gull-wing canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.

Example #2: Born in Lucerne, the third of eight siblings, to a cabin cruiser engineer, he studied art at the Académie Julian in Paris and later in Berlin, and admired artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lucerne', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Académie Julian', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Berlin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Pablo Picasso', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Georges Braque', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #3: Born in Lucerne, the third of eight siblings, to a cabin cruiser engineer, he studied art at the Académie Julian in Paris and later in Berlin, and admired artists such as Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lucerne', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Académie Julian', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Berlin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Pablo Picasso', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Georges Braque', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #4: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #5: Her mother Ceres, also known as Demeter, the goddess of agriculture or of the Earth, went looking for her across all of the world, and all in vain.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ceres', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Demeter', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #7: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: Traditionally, the winner of the men's heavyweight class will go on to compete in major national and international strongman contests such as the World's Strongest Man and the Arnold Strongman Classic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "World's Strongest Man", 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Arnold Strongman Classic', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #10: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
