Example #3: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: In 1993, she joined the national touring cast of " Jesus Christ Superstar " in the role of Mary Magdalene, alongside original film stars Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jesus Christ Superstar', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Mary Magdalene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Ted Neeley', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Carl Anderson', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #7: Howard Goodall (subsequently composer of the theme music for " Blackadder ", " Red Dwarf ", and " The Vicar of Dibley ") was musical director.

Example #8: The " cuisine of Vanuatu " (known in Bislama as " aelan kakae ") incorporates fish, root vegetables such as taro and yams, fruits, and vegetables.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Vanuatu', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bislama', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'taro', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'yams', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #9: The " cuisine of Vanuatu " (known in Bislama as " aelan kakae ") incorporates fish, root vegetables such as taro and yams, fruits, and vegetables.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Vanuatu', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bislama', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'taro', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'yams', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #10: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
