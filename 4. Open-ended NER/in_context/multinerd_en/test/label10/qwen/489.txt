Example #1: Menu items that are generally considered breakfast foods are served in the school's dining hall late at night (hence " midnight ") as a study break before or during final exams, or as a traditional community-building event.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'breakfast', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #2: With the onset of World War II, the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom established a BW program at Porton Down, headed by the microbiologist Paul Fildes.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Ministry of Supply', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'United Kingdom', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Porton Down', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Paul Fildes', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #3: With the onset of World War II, the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom established a BW program at Porton Down, headed by the microbiologist Paul Fildes.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Ministry of Supply', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'United Kingdom', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Porton Down', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Paul Fildes', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #4: Variants of the 747 remained the largest airliners flying for well over thirty years, some with a " stretched " upper deck, until the arrival of the Airbus A380 series in 2007 featuring a full-length upper deck.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Airbus A380', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #5: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #6: Hanns Bruno Geinitz described " Kreischeria wiedei " from the coal measures of Zwickau in Germany, although he interpreted it as a fossil pseudoscorpion.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hanns Bruno Geinitz', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Zwickau', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Germany', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'pseudoscorpion', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #7: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the " Voyager 1 " space probe taken on March 5, 1979, while making its flyby of Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Stephen P. Synnott', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Voyager 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
