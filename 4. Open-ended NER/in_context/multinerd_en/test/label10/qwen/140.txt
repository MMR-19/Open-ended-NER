Example #2: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Two aircraft were re-engined with a 320 " hp (239 " kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ABC Dragonfly', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Sopwith Dragon', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #6: Two aircraft were re-engined with a 320 " hp (239 " kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ABC Dragonfly', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Sopwith Dragon', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #7: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #8: Howard Goodall (subsequently composer of the theme music for " Blackadder ", " Red Dwarf ", and " The Vicar of Dibley ") was musical director.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Howard Goodall', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Blackadder', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Red Dwarf', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'The Vicar of Dibley', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #9: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Ripe fruits and fruit parts including blackthorn (sloe berries), " Aronia " chokeberry, chokecherry, bird cherry, rhubarb, quince and persimmon fruits, and banana skins are very astringent; citrus fruits, like lemons, are somewhat astringent.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aronia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'rhubarb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'quince', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'persimmon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'banana', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'
