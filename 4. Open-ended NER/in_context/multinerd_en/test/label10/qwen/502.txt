Example #1: (meat waiters) come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are speared various kinds of meat, be it beef, pork, filet mignon, lamb, chicken, duck, ham (with pineapple), sausage, fish, or any other sort of local cut of meat.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'beef', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pork', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'filet mignon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chicken', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'duck', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'ham', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sausage', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #2: Traditional dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains, as opposed to a western pattern diet characterized by processed foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer were associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia (mood disorder) and for anxiety disorders in women.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegetables', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fruit', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'meat', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'whole grains', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'western pattern diet', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'processed foods', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'beer', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dysthymia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'anxiety disorders', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #3: Globotruncanid Foraminifera and echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish (sea stars) thrived.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Foraminifera', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: It contains slices of cooked buffalo or cow lips, " bangkuang, " unripe mango, pineapple, cucumber, " kangkung ", lontong (rice cake), tofu and tempe, all served in a black sauce made from " petis " (black fermented prawn paste, related to terasi) and crushed peanuts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'buffalo', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'mango', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'cucumber', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'kangkung', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lontong', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'rice cake', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'tofu', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #5: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #6: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #8: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: Drying prevents yeasts and bread molds (" Rhizopus ") from growing by removing moisture so bacteria cannot grow.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
