Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #2: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #3: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: Menu items that are generally considered breakfast foods are served in the school's dining hall late at night (hence " midnight ") as a study break before or during final exams, or as a traditional community-building event.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'breakfast', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #6: Howard Goodall (subsequently composer of the theme music for " Blackadder ", " Red Dwarf ", and " The Vicar of Dibley ") was musical director.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Howard Goodall', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Blackadder', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Red Dwarf', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'The Vicar of Dibley', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #7: The symbol for 2 Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2 Pallas', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Pallas Athena', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Franz Xaver von Zach', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Mars', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: " obložený chlebíček ") - slant ways cut slice of " veka " (long narrow white bread) spread with butter and / or with various combinations of mayonnaise salads and hard boiled egg, cheese, ham, salami, smoked fish (salmon or sprats or pickled herring), tomato, pickled cucumber, lettuce, raw onion or other vegetable, etc.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'veka', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'butter', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'mayonnaise', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'cheese', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'ham', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'salami', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'salmon', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'sprats', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'herring', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'tomato', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'pickled cucumber', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lettuce', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'onion', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #9: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
