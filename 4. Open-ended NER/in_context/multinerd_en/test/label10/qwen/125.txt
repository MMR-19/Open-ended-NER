Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Candida', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Scedosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: are a common cause of bacterial diarrhea, but infections by " Salmonella " spp., " Shigella " spp.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Shigella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: " obložený chlebíček ") - slant ways cut slice of " veka " (long narrow white bread) spread with butter and / or with various combinations of mayonnaise salads and hard boiled egg, cheese, ham, salami, smoked fish (salmon or sprats or pickled herring), tomato, pickled cucumber, lettuce, raw onion or other vegetable, etc.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'veka', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'butter', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'mayonnaise', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'cheese', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'ham', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'salami', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'salmon', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'sprats', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'herring', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'tomato', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'pickled cucumber', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lettuce', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'onion', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #8: He also protected the deceased against various demons (named " inmetjw " in the texts) sent by Seth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Seth', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #9: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
