Example #1: According to one such tradition, she is the personification of the Earth itself; according to another, its actual mother, being " Prithvi Tattwa ", the essence of the element earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Prithvi Tattwa', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #2: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: On February 3, 1966 " Luna 9 " spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 9', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'lunar', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: On February 3, 1966 " Luna 9 " spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 9', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'lunar', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: The most observed and familiar example of planetshine is earthshine on the Moon, which is most visible from the night side of Earth when the lunar phase is crescent or nearly new, without the atmospheric brightness of the daytime sky.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Moon', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'new', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #7: Her mother Ceres, also known as Demeter, the goddess of agriculture or of the Earth, went looking for her across all of the world, and all in vain.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ceres', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Demeter', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #8: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #10: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'
