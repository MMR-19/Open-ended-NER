Example #1: Sulforaphane, a glucosinolate breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'broccoli', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'prostate cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #2: Similarly, David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz of SBS's " The Movie Show " were not impressed by the film's content and tone.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'David Stratton', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Margaret Pomeranz', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'SBS', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'The Movie Show', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #3: Over the course of the Middle Kingdom, however, he was displaced in that role by Amun, who may have arisen elsewhere.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Middle Kingdom', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'Amun', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #4: It was supplanted by Egyptian Arabic as a spoken language toward the early modern period, but language revitalisation efforts have been underway since the 19th century.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Egyptian Arabic', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'early modern period', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #5: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #8: The genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from " Agrobacterium ", with genes actively expressed by the plants.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Agrobacterium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14 – 15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'V-J Day', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'New York City Department of Sanitation', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #10: While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14 – 15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'V-J Day', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'New York City Department of Sanitation', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'
