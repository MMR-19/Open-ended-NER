Example #1: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: as well as the " Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter " and " MAVEN ", were healthy after the Comet Siding Spring flyby.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'MAVEN', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Comet Siding Spring', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #8: Other bacterial species such as " Nitrobacter ", are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrite into nitrate.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nitrobacter', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #10: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
