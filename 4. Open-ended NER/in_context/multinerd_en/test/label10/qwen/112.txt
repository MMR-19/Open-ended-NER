Example #1: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: It was discovered by Stephen P. Synnott in images from the " Voyager 1 " space probe taken on March 5, 1979, while making its flyby of Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Stephen P. Synnott', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Voyager 1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: He caused controversy in 1988 by what Nicholas Kenyon called " plans to create a high level conservatory … for soloists on the model of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia ", cutting the academy's total number of students.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nicholas Kenyon', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Curtis Institute', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Philadelphia', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: In March 2010, the girls stated their goals: to take first place on Oricon, to participate in " Kōhaku Uta Gassen ", to perform at Budokan.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Oricon', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Kōhaku Uta Gassen', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Budokan', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #6: Developments then turned back to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with the " Pathfinder " (1997) and subsequent designs, culminating in the " Helios " which set the altitude record for a non-rocket-propelled aircraft at in 2001.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pathfinder', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Helios', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #7: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #8: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #9: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: Nevertheless, he was encouraged to begin work (1869) on a major choral work, " Les Béatitudes ", which was to occupy him for more than ten years, the delay partly due to the interruptions of the Franco-Prussian War.
