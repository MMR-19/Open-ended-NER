Example #1: Although originally described by Philippi in 1858 it has long remained buried in other taxa, principally " Hippeastrum " and more recently " Rhodophiala ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Philippi', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hippeastrum', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'Rhodophiala', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #2: In 1996, the car received a modification upgrade, resulting in similar track times to those of the Ferrari 355 Challenge.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ferrari 355 Challenge', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #3: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #5: Sulforaphane, a glucosinolate breakdown product, which may be found in vegetables such as broccoli, has been shown to be protective against prostate cancer, however, much of it is destroyed when the vegetable is boiled.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'broccoli', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'prostate cancer', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #6: The War of the Spanish Succession lasted 11 years, and ended when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in 1714.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'War of the Spanish Succession', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Treaty of Utrecht', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #7: The colonists enjoyed butter in cooking as well, but it was rare prior to the American Revolution, as cattle were not yet plentiful.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'butter', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'American Revolution', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'cattle', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #8: The park's elevation and dry desert air, along with the relatively stable atmosphere in the region, often make for excellent seeing conditions.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'dry', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'relatively stable', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #9: The 330's design was refined and heavily modified, resulting in the Short 360.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Short 360', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #10: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'
