Example #1: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Other bacterial species such as " Nitrobacter ", are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrite into nitrate.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nitrobacter', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: A " spider roll " is a type of " makizushi " sushi that includes breaded or battered soft-shell crab and other ingredients such as cucumber, avocado, daikon sprouts or lettuce, and spicy mayonnaise, rolled inside nori and sushi rice.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sushi', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'soft-shell crab', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'cucumber', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'avocado', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'daikon', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'lettuce', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'mayonnaise', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'nori', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #5: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: His trip was filmed for " The American Sportsman " on ABC, although all did not go well at first as the salmon were not running.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The American Sportsman', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'ABC', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'salmon', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #7: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #8: Some recipes also call for small quantities of star anise, asafoetida, chili, stone flower (known as " dagadphool "), and " kababchini " (" cubeb ").
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'asafoetida', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chili', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'stone flower', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #9: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: They are catalogued in reference works such as the " Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings', 'entity': 'Instrument'}]'
