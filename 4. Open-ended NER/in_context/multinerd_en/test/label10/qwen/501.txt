Example #4: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #8: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #9: He lost his place in the 2000 – 01 season, and joined Cheltenham Town on loan on 23 February until the end of the season, when he returned to Ashton Gate and continued to try to win a place in Danny Wilson's side.
