Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.

Example #10: While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14 – 15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.
