Example #4: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #5: Two aircraft were re-engined with a 320 " hp (239 " kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ABC Dragonfly', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Sopwith Dragon', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #6: Two aircraft were re-engined with a 320 " hp (239 " kW) ABC Dragonfly radial engine and these entered production as the Sopwith Dragon.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ABC Dragonfly', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Sopwith Dragon', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #7: (meat waiters) come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are speared various kinds of meat, be it beef, pork, filet mignon, lamb, chicken, duck, ham (with pineapple), sausage, fish, or any other sort of local cut of meat.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'beef', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pork', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'filet mignon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chicken', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'duck', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'ham', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sausage', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #8: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: He was replaced in that role by Osiris during the Middle Kingdom (2000 – 1700 BC).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Osiris', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Middle Kingdom', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #10: Nevertheless, he was encouraged to begin work (1869) on a major choral work, " Les Béatitudes ", which was to occupy him for more than ten years, the delay partly due to the interruptions of the Franco-Prussian War.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Les Béatitudes', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Franco-Prussian War', 'entity': 'Event'}]'
