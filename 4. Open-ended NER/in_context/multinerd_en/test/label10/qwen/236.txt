Example #1: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #3: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: The " cuisine of Vanuatu " (known in Bislama as " aelan kakae ") incorporates fish, root vegetables such as taro and yams, fruits, and vegetables.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Vanuatu', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bislama', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'taro', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'yams', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #8: The " cuisine of Vanuatu " (known in Bislama as " aelan kakae ") incorporates fish, root vegetables such as taro and yams, fruits, and vegetables.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Vanuatu', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bislama', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'taro', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'yams', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #9: A " spider roll " is a type of " makizushi " sushi that includes breaded or battered soft-shell crab and other ingredients such as cucumber, avocado, daikon sprouts or lettuce, and spicy mayonnaise, rolled inside nori and sushi rice.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sushi', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'soft-shell crab', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'cucumber', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'avocado', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'daikon', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'lettuce', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'mayonnaise', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'nori', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #10: This is unlike the original cartoon, which featured other stories such as " Tom Slick " and " Super Chicken ".
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tom Slick', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Super Chicken', 'entity': 'Media'}]'
