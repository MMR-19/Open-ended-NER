Example #7: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #8: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #9: This is the fertilized eggs or roe (" qaarsat, meluk, imlauk ") of the Pacific herring attached to eelgrass, seaweed or other submerged vegetation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'roe', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'Pacific herring', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'eelgrass', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #10: Menu items that are generally considered breakfast foods are served in the school's dining hall late at night (hence " midnight ") as a study break before or during final exams, or as a traditional community-building event.
