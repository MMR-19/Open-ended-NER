Example #2: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.

Example #3: His " " Monoplane " " was a large aircraft made of aluminium, with a wingspan of and a weight of only without the pilot.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Monoplane', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #4: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: In Denmark, " gløgg " pairings typically include æbleskiver sprinkled with powdered sugar and accompanied with strawberry marmalade.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Denmark', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'æbleskiver', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'powdered sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'strawberry', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'marmalade', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #7: It contains slices of cooked buffalo or cow lips, " bangkuang, " unripe mango, pineapple, cucumber, " kangkung ", lontong (rice cake), tofu and tempe, all served in a black sauce made from " petis " (black fermented prawn paste, related to terasi) and crushed peanuts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'buffalo', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'mango', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'cucumber', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'kangkung', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lontong', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'rice cake', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'tofu', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #8: In Indonesia, a type of traditional ice cream called " es puter " or " stirred ice cream " is made from coconut milk, pandanus leaves, sugar - and flavors that include avocado, jackfruit, durian, palm sugar, chocolate, red bean, and mung bean.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Indonesia', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'pandanus', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'avocado', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'jackfruit', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'durian', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'palm sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chocolate', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'red bean', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'mung bean', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'

Example #9: The genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of DNA from " Agrobacterium ", with genes actively expressed by the plants.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Agrobacterium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: The " cuisine of Vanuatu " (known in Bislama as " aelan kakae ") incorporates fish, root vegetables such as taro and yams, fruits, and vegetables.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Vanuatu', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bislama', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'taro', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'yams', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'
