Example #1: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: Strains of " Escherichia coli " and " Vibrio cholerae " lacking Hsp33 were rendered especially sensitive to HOCl.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #3: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: Her first lead role on a television series was in David E. Kelley's legal drama " Harry's Law ", which began airing on NBC on January 17, 2011, but was later cancelled on May 14, 2012.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'David E. Kelley', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': "Harry's Law", 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'NBC', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #5: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: A " spider roll " is a type of " makizushi " sushi that includes breaded or battered soft-shell crab and other ingredients such as cucumber, avocado, daikon sprouts or lettuce, and spicy mayonnaise, rolled inside nori and sushi rice.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sushi', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'soft-shell crab', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'cucumber', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'avocado', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'daikon', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'lettuce', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'mayonnaise', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'nori', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #8: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: Other bacterial species such as " Nitrobacter ", are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrite into nitrate.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nitrobacter', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
