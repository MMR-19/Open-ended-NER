Example #1: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #4: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: It began approximately in the mid-18 th century and depending on the author either ended with the beginning of contemporary history after World War II, or includes that period up to the present day.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'contemporary history', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #6: Less commonly seen in developed countries are organisms such as " Vibrio cholerae " which causes cholera and various strains of " Salmonella " which cause typhoid and para-typhoid diseases.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'cholera', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Salmonella', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: Her mother Ceres, also known as Demeter, the goddess of agriculture or of the Earth, went looking for her across all of the world, and all in vain.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ceres', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Demeter', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #9: His mother, Cheri Lynn Honkala, is a noted advocate for the homeless in Philadelphia, and was the vice-presidential nominee of the Green Party in the 2012 presidential election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cheri Lynn Honkala', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Philadelphia', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Green Party', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #10: The symbol for 2 Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2 Pallas', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Pallas Athena', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Franz Xaver von Zach', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Mars', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
