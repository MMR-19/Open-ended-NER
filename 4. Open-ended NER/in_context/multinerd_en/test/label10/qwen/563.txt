Example #3: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #4: In finance, " default " is failure to meet the legal obligations (or conditions) of a loan, for example when a home buyer fails to make a mortgage payment, or when a corporation or government fails to pay a bond which has reached maturity.

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #8: The two Tumansky R-11 turbojet engines, initially with 57 " kN (12,795 " lbf) thrust each, were mounted in pods, similar to the previous Yak-25.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tumansky R-11', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'Yak-25', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #9: Howard Goodall (subsequently composer of the theme music for " Blackadder ", " Red Dwarf ", and " The Vicar of Dibley ") was musical director.
