Example #1: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: For example, although the typical recipe calls for beef and pork, the Kiev variant uses mutton or lamb as well as beef, while in the Poltava region, the stock for borscht is cooked on poultry meat, that is, chicken, duck or goose.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Kiev', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'mutton or lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'Poltava', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'goose', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #6: The park's elevation and dry desert air, along with the relatively stable atmosphere in the region, often make for excellent seeing conditions.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'dry', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'relatively stable', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #7: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #8: Following the Civil War, Reconstruction Era economic expansion led to an increase in logging and deforestation, especially in the southern Adirondacks.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Civil War', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Reconstruction Era', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'Adirondacks', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #9: Billions of people are killed in World War III, and most of the surviving males are rendered sterile.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'World War III', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'sterile', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #10: An older sister, Susan, is a rabbi who lives in Jerusalem with her husband, Yosef Abramowitz, the co-founder and president of Arava Power Company, and their five children.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Susan', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jerusalem', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Yosef Abramowitz', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Arava Power Company', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'
