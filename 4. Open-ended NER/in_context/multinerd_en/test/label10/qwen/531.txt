Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Plasmodium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #4: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: Other research fields in which chinchillas are used as an animal model include the study of Chagas disease, gastrointestinal diseases, pneumonia, and listeriosis, as well as of " Yersinia " and " Pseudomonas " infections.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chagas disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'pneumonia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'listeriosis', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Yersinia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'Pseudomonas', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #6: Better documented, the bacterium " Pseudomonas aeruginosa " and the fungus " Cladosporium resinae " are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cladosporium', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #7: (meat waiters) come to the table with knives and a skewer, on which are speared various kinds of meat, be it beef, pork, filet mignon, lamb, chicken, duck, ham (with pineapple), sausage, fish, or any other sort of local cut of meat.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'beef', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pork', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'filet mignon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'lamb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'chicken', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'duck', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'ham', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'pineapple', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sausage', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #8: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #9: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #10: Billions of people are killed in World War III, and most of the surviving males are rendered sterile.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'World War III', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'sterile', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'
