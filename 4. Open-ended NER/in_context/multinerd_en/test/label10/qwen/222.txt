Example #1: On February 3, 1966 " Luna 9 " spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 9', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'lunar', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: On February 3, 1966 " Luna 9 " spacecraft was the first spacecraft to achieve a lunar soft landing and to transmit photographic data to Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Luna 9', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'lunar', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #3: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #4: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #5: The symbol for 2 Pallas, the spear of Pallas Athena, was invented by Baron Franz Xaver von Zach, who organized a group of twenty-four astronomers to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2 Pallas', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Pallas Athena', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Franz Xaver von Zach', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Mars', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14 – 15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'V-J Day', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'New York City Department of Sanitation', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #7: While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14 – 15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'V-J Day', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'New York City Department of Sanitation', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'

Example #8: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #9: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #10: He was honoured for his pioneering work on prevention of Rh disease of the newborn, and also for his work on the genetics of the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rh disease', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Lepidoptera', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'
