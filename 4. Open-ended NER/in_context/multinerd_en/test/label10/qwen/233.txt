Example #1: By inserting separate, successive sections of " V. cholerae " DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as " E. coli " that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which " V. cholerae " responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'E. coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: A " spider roll " is a type of " makizushi " sushi that includes breaded or battered soft-shell crab and other ingredients such as cucumber, avocado, daikon sprouts or lettuce, and spicy mayonnaise, rolled inside nori and sushi rice.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sushi', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'soft-shell crab', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'cucumber', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'avocado', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'daikon', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'lettuce', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'mayonnaise', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'nori', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #3: While the therapy cannot undo the effects of a person's first puberty, developing secondary sex characteristics associated with a different sex can relieve some or all of the distress and discomfort associated with gender dysphoria, and can help the person to " pass " or be seen as the gender they identify with.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'puberty', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'gender dysphoria', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #4: Menu items that are generally considered breakfast foods are served in the school's dining hall late at night (hence " midnight ") as a study break before or during final exams, or as a traditional community-building event.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'breakfast', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'

Example #5: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #6: Suspensions of bacteria, specifically " Escherichia coli " and " Shewanella oneidensis ", were placed in the DAC, and the pressure was raised to 1.6 " GPa, which is more than 16,000 " times Earth's surface pressure (985 " hPa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #7: " Escherichia coli " is one of the most important model organisms, and its genetics and biochemistry have been closely studied.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #8: " Soft commodities ", or " softs ", are commodities such as coffee, cocoa, sugar, corn, wheat, soybean, fruit and livestock.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'coffee', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'cocoa', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'sugar', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'corn', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'wheat', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'soybean', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'fruit', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'livestock', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #9: In sourdough bread-making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the " Lactobacilli ", which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lactobacilli', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #10: It is also used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in high-risk people having dental work done, to prevent " Streptococcus pneumoniae " and other encapsulated bacterial infections in those without spleens, such as people with sickle-cell disease, and for both the prevention and the treatment of anthrax.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Streptococcus pneumoniae', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
