Example #1: The hyphae of the common mold (" Rhizopus ") are capable of producing both mitotic as well as meiotic spores.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhizopus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'

Example #2: " Aspergillus " and other moulds play an important role in these consortia because they are adept at recycling starches, hemicelluloses, celluloses, pectins and other sugar polymers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aspergillus', 'entity': 'Biological entity'}]'
