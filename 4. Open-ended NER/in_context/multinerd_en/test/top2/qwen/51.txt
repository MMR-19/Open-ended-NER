Example #1: In antiquity it was a place of worship, because it was believed to be the cave where the titan Rhea hid the infant Zeus, to protect him from his father Cronus who intended to swallow him like others of his progeny.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhea', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Zeus', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Cronus', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #2: From the tropics and middle latitudes, the Sun is visible in the sky at its upper culmination (at solar noon) and invisible (below the horizon) at its lower culmination (at solar midnight).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sun', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'midnight', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
