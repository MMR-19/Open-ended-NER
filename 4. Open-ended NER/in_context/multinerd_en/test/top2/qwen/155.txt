Example #1: Hanns Bruno Geinitz described " Kreischeria wiedei " from the coal measures of Zwickau in Germany, although he interpreted it as a fossil pseudoscorpion.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hanns Bruno Geinitz', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Zwickau', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Germany', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'pseudoscorpion', 'entity': 'Animal'}]'

Example #2: Designed as a four-seat development of the Bede BD-12, which was, in turn, a two-seat version of the single-seat Bede BD-5, the BD-14 was to feature a cantilever low-wing, a four-seat enclosed cockpit under a gull-wing canopy, retractable tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Bede BD-12', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Bede BD-5', 'entity': 'Media'}]'
