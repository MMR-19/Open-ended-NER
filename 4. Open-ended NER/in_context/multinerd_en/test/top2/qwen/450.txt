Example #1: At our current top speed of, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years, much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster transportation methods than currently available.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Helios 2', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Proxima Centauri', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: An attempt of producing and airliner PZL MD-12 was unsuccessful.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'PZL MD-12', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'
