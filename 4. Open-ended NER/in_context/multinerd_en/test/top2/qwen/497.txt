Example #1: Similarly, David Stratton and Margaret Pomeranz of SBS's " The Movie Show " were not impressed by the film's content and tone.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'David Stratton', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Margaret Pomeranz', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'SBS', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'The Movie Show', 'entity': 'Media'}]'

Example #2: The two films and the holdovers " Jurassic World " and " Inside Out " were each projected to earn $ 45 – 55 million during the Independence Day holiday period and $ 27 – 30 million over the three-day weekend.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jurassic World', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Inside Out', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Independence Day', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
