Example #1: In antiquity it was a place of worship, because it was believed to be the cave where the titan Rhea hid the infant Zeus, to protect him from his father Cronus who intended to swallow him like others of his progeny.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhea', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Zeus', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Cronus', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'

Example #2: The second monumental sector was attributed to the god Anu by the excavators of the site, because it was the location of a sanctuary for this god some 3000 years later.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Anu', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'
