Example #1: The area, which included a number of major aviation firms, was heavily bombed in the opening days of the Battle of Britain, including one famous low-level raid by a group of Dornier Do 17 s.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Battle of Britain', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Dornier Do 17', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'V-J Day', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'New York City Department of Sanitation', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'
