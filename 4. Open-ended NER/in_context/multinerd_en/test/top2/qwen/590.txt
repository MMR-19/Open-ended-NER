Example #1: In many climates grass growth is seasonal, for example in the temperate summer or tropical rainy season, so some areas of the crop are set aside to be cut and preserved, either as hay (dried grass), or as silage (fermented grass).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'summer', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'hay', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'silage', 'entity': 'Food'}]'

Example #2: Ripe fruits and fruit parts including blackthorn (sloe berries), " Aronia " chokeberry, chokecherry, bird cherry, rhubarb, quince and persimmon fruits, and banana skins are very astringent; citrus fruits, like lemons, are somewhat astringent.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aronia', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'rhubarb', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'quince', 'entity': 'Plant'}, {'span': 'persimmon', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'banana', 'entity': 'Plant'}]'
