Example #1: For example, Hyperion, a satellite of Saturn, exhibits this behaviour, and its rotation period is described as chaotic.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hyperion', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: The moon-goddess Selene is commonly depicted with a crescent moon, often accompanied by two stars (the stars represent Phosphorus, the morning star, and Hesperus, the evening star); sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Selene', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}, {'span': 'Phosphorus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}, {'span': 'Hesperus', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'
