Example #1: His first major league hit was a fourth-inning single off Drew Smyly in a 4&ndash; 1 loss to the Detroit Tigers at Camden Yards six nights later on May 13.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Drew Smyly', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Detroit Tigers', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Camden Yards', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: Nevertheless, he was encouraged to begin work (1869) on a major choral work, " Les Béatitudes ", which was to occupy him for more than ten years, the delay partly due to the interruptions of the Franco-Prussian War.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Les Béatitudes', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Franco-Prussian War', 'entity': 'Event'}]'
