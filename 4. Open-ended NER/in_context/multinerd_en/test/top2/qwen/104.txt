Example #1: Variants of the 747 remained the largest airliners flying for well over thirty years, some with a " stretched " upper deck, until the arrival of the Airbus A380 series in 2007 featuring a full-length upper deck.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Airbus A380', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #2: The museum also has a Tupolev Tu-144 on display " – this is the only place where both supersonic airliners can be seen together.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tupolev Tu-144', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'
