Example #1: Nevertheless, he was encouraged to begin work (1869) on a major choral work, " Les Béatitudes ", which was to occupy him for more than ten years, the delay partly due to the interruptions of the Franco-Prussian War.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Les Béatitudes', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'Franco-Prussian War', 'entity': 'Event'}]'
