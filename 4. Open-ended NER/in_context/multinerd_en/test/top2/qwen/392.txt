Example #1: The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'European Space Agency', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Olympus-1', 'entity': 'Instrument'}, {'span': 'meteoroid', 'entity': 'Celestial Body'}]'

Example #2: While typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14 – 15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'V-J Day', 'entity': 'Time'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'New York City Department of Sanitation', 'entity': 'Organization'}]'
