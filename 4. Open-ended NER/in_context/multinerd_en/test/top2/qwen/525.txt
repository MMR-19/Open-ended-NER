Example #1: Each kalpa lasts for 4.32 billion years and is followed by a pralaya of equal length, which together makes one full day and night of Brahma's 100 360-year lifespan, who lives for 311 trillion, 40 billion years.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Brahma', 'entity': 'Mythological entity'}]'
