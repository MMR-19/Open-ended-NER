Example #1: This aircraft would replace the Fairey Fulmar, which had been viewed as an interim design.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fairey Fulmar', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'

Example #2: These were used for only a short time before being replaced by Yak-11 s and Yak-18 s in late 1952.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Yak-11', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}, {'span': 'Yak-18', 'entity': 'Vehicle'}]'
