Example #1: Traditional dietary patterns characterized by vegetables, fruit, meat, fish, and whole grains, as opposed to a western pattern diet characterized by processed foods, refined grains, sugary products, and beer were associated with lower odds for major depression or dysthymia (mood disorder) and for anxiety disorders in women.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'vegetables', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fruit', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'meat', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'fish', 'entity': 'Animal'}, {'span': 'whole grains', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'western pattern diet', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'processed foods', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'beer', 'entity': 'Food'}, {'span': 'dysthymia', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'anxiety disorders', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #2: In finance, " default " is failure to meet the legal obligations (or conditions) of a loan, for example when a home buyer fails to make a mortgage payment, or when a corporation or government fails to pay a bond which has reached maturity.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'legal obligations (or conditions)', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'maturity', 'entity': 'Time'}]'
