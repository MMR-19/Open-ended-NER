Example #1: The " Yoga Journal " provides separate lists of asanas that it states are " inadvisable " and should be avoided or modified for each of the following medical conditions: asthma; back injury; carpal tunnel syndrome; diarrhoea; headache; heart problems; high blood pressure; insomnia; knee injury; low blood pressure; menstruation; neck injury; pregnancy; and shoulder injury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Yoga Journal', 'entity': 'Media'}, {'span': 'asthma', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'carpal tunnel syndrome', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'insomnia', 'entity': 'Disease'}]'

Example #2: In 2010, a team led by Zahi Hawass reported that the young king had died from a combination of a broken leg, malaria and Köhler disease but another team from the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg believes his death was caused by sickle cell disease.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Zahi Hawass', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'malaria', 'entity': 'Disease'}, {'span': 'Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine', 'entity': 'Organization'}, {'span': 'Hamburg', 'entity': 'Location'}]'
