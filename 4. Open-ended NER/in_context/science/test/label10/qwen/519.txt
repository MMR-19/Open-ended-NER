Example #1: Al-Farabi's school of philosophy breaks with the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle ... and ... moves from metaphysics to methodology, a move that anticipates modernity, and at the level of philosophy, Alfarabi unites theory and practice ... and in the sphere of the Politics he liberates practice from theory.

Example #4: On migrating to the blood stream, nitrogen dioxide poisoning results in an irreversible inhibition of the Acetylcholinesterase which may lead to muscular paralysis, convulsions, bronchoconstriction, the narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchi and bronchioles) and death by asphyxia tion.

Example #6: In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber.
