Example #1: They may also use Adenosine triphosphate, Nitric oxide, and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Nitric oxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ROS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #2: They found seven universally clustered pathways: glycolysis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, ATP synthase, DNA polymerase, hexachlorocyclohexane degradation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and photosynthesis (Adenosine diphosphate synthesis in non plant species).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'aminoacyl-tRNA', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ATP synthase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'hexachlorocyclohexane', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'cyanoamino acid', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'photosynthesis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Adenosine diphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #3: Pacific Union College, classified as a National Liberal Arts College by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, is the county's only four-year college and serves roughly 1,500 students.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pacific Union College', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: She is awakened as a Soldier by the white cat Artemis when she is thirteen years old and instructed that she has a duty to become the beautiful warrior, Sailor V. Artemis explains that Venus and Earth are twin planets of about the same size and weight, that Venus is her mother star, and that she must protect Earth from its enemies.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artemis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Sailor V. Artemis', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #5: In 1969, Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman, a University of East London lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death, when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Shenton', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Ellis Hillman', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'University of East London', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Flat Earth Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Science Fiction Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #6: Also, Mercury's fairly eccentric orbit makes it much easier to detect the perihelion shift than is the case for the nearly circular orbits of Venus and Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #7: Lin is recognized for his contributions to stem cell research, especially for his discoveries of the Piwi / Argonaute (AGO) gene family and the Piwi-interacting RNA s (piRNAs), and for proving the stem cell niche theory.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'stem cell', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Piwi', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Argonaute', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'AGO', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Piwi-interacting RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'piRNAs', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'stem cell niche theory', 'entity': 'Theory'}]'

Example #8: The Hannes Alfvén Prize, awarded annually by the European Physical Society for outstanding contributions in plasma physics, is named after him.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hannes Alfvén Prize', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'European Physical Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'plasma physics', 'entity': 'Discipline'}]'

Example #9: The two-part finale's epic scale and underlying plot was first conceived in early 2007 as the last regular-series story for departing producer s Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner, and Phil Collinson: the fourth series finale is the last story produced by Collinson; and Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger replaced Davies and Gardner as show runner and executive producer respectively in 2010.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Russell T Davies', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Julie Gardner', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Phil Collinson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Collinson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Steven Moffat', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Piers Wenger', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Davies', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Gardner', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #10: In dimension 2 (i.e. surface s), the mapping class group is a finitely presented group generated by Dehn twist s (Max Dehn, W. B. R. Lickorish, Allen Hatcher).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'finitely presented group', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Dehn twist', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Max Dehn', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'W. B. R. Lickorish', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Allen Hatcher', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
