Example #4: In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber.
