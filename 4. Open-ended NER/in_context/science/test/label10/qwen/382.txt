Example #1: Al-Farabi's school of philosophy breaks with the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle ... and ... moves from metaphysics to methodology, a move that anticipates modernity, and at the level of philosophy, Alfarabi unites theory and practice ... and in the sphere of the Politics he liberates practice from theory.

Example #3: Xu noted that under the near-null magnetic field, Arabidopsis thaliana delays the flowering time by altering the transcription level of three cryptochrome related florigen genes: Phytochrome, CO, and FT; Arabidopsis thaliana also induced longer hypocotyl length under white light in the Near-Null magnetic field compared to standard geomagnetic field and either dark or white light conditions.

Example #6: Rhea was not named until 1847, when John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of the planet Uranus, and two other moons of Saturn, Mimas and Enceladus) suggested in Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope that the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Kronos (Saturn, in Roman mythology), be used.
