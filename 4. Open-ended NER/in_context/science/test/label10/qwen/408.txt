Example #3: The American Breeders Association held its first meeting in 1903 to discuss the new science of genetics that arose from Charles Darwin s theory of evolution and Gregor Mendel s discoveries of the laws of inheritance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'American Breeders Association', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Charles Darwin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'theory of evolution', 'entity': 'Theory'}, {'span': 'Gregor Mendel', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #4: She is awakened as a Soldier by the white cat Artemis when she is thirteen years old and instructed that she has a duty to become the beautiful warrior, Sailor V. Artemis explains that Venus and Earth are twin planets of about the same size and weight, that Venus is her mother star, and that she must protect Earth from its enemies.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artemis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Sailor V. Artemis', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #5: Rhea was not named until 1847, when John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of the planet Uranus, and two other moons of Saturn, Mimas and Enceladus) suggested in Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope that the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Kronos (Saturn, in Roman mythology), be used.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Rhea', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'John Herschel', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'William Herschel', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Uranus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Mimas', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Enceladus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Cape of Good Hope', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Titans', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Kronos', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Roman', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #6: Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation is an immediate DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification of Histone and other nuclear proteins that contributes to the survival of injured proliferating cells.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Histone', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'nuclear proteins', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #7: Xu noted that under the near-null magnetic field, Arabidopsis thaliana delays the flowering time by altering the transcription level of three cryptochrome related florigen genes: Phytochrome, CO, and FT; Arabidopsis thaliana also induced longer hypocotyl length under white light in the Near-Null magnetic field compared to standard geomagnetic field and either dark or white light conditions.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Xu', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'near-null magnetic field', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Arabidopsis thaliana', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'cryptochrome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'florigen', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Phytochrome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CO', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'FT', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'hypocotyl', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Near-Null magnetic field', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'geomagnetic field', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #8: Other silencing mechanisms include the recruitment of specialized proteins that methylate DNA such that the core promoter element is inaccessible to transcription factor s and RNA polymerase.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'silencing mechanisms', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'transcription factor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #9: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #10: However, Health Canada, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Medical Association, the National Academies of Sciences, the World Health Organization, and several other scientific and medical institutions from around the world have all concluded that genetically modified foods are safe to eat.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Health Canada', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'American Association for the Advancement of Science', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'American Medical Association', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'National Academies of Sciences', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'World Health Organization', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
