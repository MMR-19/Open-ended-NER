Example #1: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.

Example #2: This discovery, which earned him the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1825, was followed by another, that a rotating plate of copper tends to communicate its motion to a magnetic needle suspended over it, which he called magnetism of rotation Annales de chimie et de physique (1824), vol.

Example #3: Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS detergent, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'lipid bilayer', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'SDS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triton X-100', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'X-114', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CHAPS detergent', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'DOC', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'NP-40', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #4: In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber.

Example #5: They found seven universally clustered pathways: glycolysis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, ATP synthase, DNA polymerase, hexachlorocyclohexane degradation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and photosynthesis (Adenosine diphosphate synthesis in non plant species).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'aminoacyl-tRNA', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ATP synthase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'hexachlorocyclohexane', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'cyanoamino acid', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'photosynthesis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Adenosine diphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #6: She is awakened as a Soldier by the white cat Artemis when she is thirteen years old and instructed that she has a duty to become the beautiful warrior, Sailor V. Artemis explains that Venus and Earth are twin planets of about the same size and weight, that Venus is her mother star, and that she must protect Earth from its enemies.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artemis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Sailor V. Artemis', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #7: Also, Mercury's fairly eccentric orbit makes it much easier to detect the perihelion shift than is the case for the nearly circular orbits of Venus and Earth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #8: Stockport played for eight seasons from the 1895-96 season to the end of 1902-1903 season, the latter two seasons played at Edgeley Park, the club finished 17th of 22 in the initial combined league, then 5th, 11th, 11th, 9th, 12th, 6th, in the 14-club Lancashire Senior Competition, and then 18th of 18 in Division 2 of the recombined league, after which it withdrew from the Northern Rugby Football Union.

Example #9: In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5 to 3 direction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA replication', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA primers', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #10: In order to get a meaningful sulfur signal from the analysis, the buffer should not contain sulfur (i.e. no BES, DDT, HEPES, MES, MOPS, or PIPES compounds).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sulfur', 'entity': 'Chemical Element'}, {'span': 'BES', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'DDT', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'HEPES', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'MES', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'MOPS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'PIPES', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'
