Example #1: The two-part finale's epic scale and underlying plot was first conceived in early 2007 as the last regular-series story for departing producer s Russell T Davies, Julie Gardner, and Phil Collinson: the fourth series finale is the last story produced by Collinson; and Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger replaced Davies and Gardner as show runner and executive producer respectively in 2010.

Example #2: Knowles was heavily influenced by the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 1970s prior to the album's recording, prompting her to work with several like-minded producers and songwriters such as Jack Splash, CeeLo Green, Mark Ronson, and former Holland-Dozier-Holland member Lamont Dozier.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Knowles', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Motown Sound', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Jack Splash', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'CeeLo Green', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Mark Ronson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Holland-Dozier-Holland', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Lamont Dozier', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #3: The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicist s Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Emilio Segrè', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Owen Chamberlain', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #4: The IERS was established in its present form in 1987 by the International Astronomical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, replacing the earlier International Polar Motion Service (IPMS) and the Earth rotation section of the Bureau International de l 'Heure (BIH).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'IERS', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'International Astronomical Union', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'International Polar Motion Service', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'IPMS', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': "Earth rotation section of the Bureau International de l 'Heure", 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'BIH', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: The journal establishment was similar to the starting of The Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal by George Ellery Hale.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The Astrophysical Journal', 'entity': 'Academic Journal'}, {'span': 'The Astronomical Journal', 'entity': 'Academic Journal'}, {'span': 'George Ellery Hale', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #6: He described Bleach's portrayal as a halfway house between the original version as played by Michael Wisher and the more exuberant ... turn by Terry Molloy.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Michael Wisher', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Terry Molloy', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #7: Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS detergent, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'lipid bilayer', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'SDS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triton X-100', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'X-114', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CHAPS detergent', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'DOC', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'NP-40', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #8: It contains abundant speculation about technological invention, including descriptions of a worldwide telephone network, solar power, air travel, space travel to the planets Saturn and Jupiter, and terraforming engineering projects damming the Arctic Ocean, and adjusting the Earth's (Terra) axial tilt (by the Terrestrial Axis Straightening Company).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Arctic Ocean', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #9: Pacific Union College, classified as a National Liberal Arts College by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, is the county's only four-year college and serves roughly 1,500 students.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Pacific Union College', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #10: The relative positions of five planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury) were shown, as were the moon's phases and the position of the Sun in the zodiac.
