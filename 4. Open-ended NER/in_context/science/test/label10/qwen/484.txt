Example #1: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.

Example #2: Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS detergent, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'lipid bilayer', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'SDS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triton X-100', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'X-114', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CHAPS detergent', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'DOC', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'NP-40', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #3: Her laboratory has determined the structures of numerous large protein complexes that play critically important roles in immune signaling, including structures of TRAFs, Myddosome and IKK-beta in Toll-like receptor, the Inflammasome, and the synaptic Recombination-activating gene.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'TRAFs', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Myddosome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'IKK-beta', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Toll-like receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Inflammasome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'synaptic Recombination-activating gene', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: In the early days of his laboratory he discovered a new mechanism of microRNA processing independent of Dicer that requires the catalytic activity of Argonaute 2, a type of Argonaute protein.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'microRNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Dicer', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'Argonaute 2', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Argonaute', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #5: He also studies the Kuiper Belt and transitional objects such as 2060 Chiron and 5145 Pholus, as well as the occasional comets as with the recent Deep impact mission that travelled to Comet Tempel 1, and near-Earth asteroids with the occasional use of the Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescope s.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Kuiper Belt', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': '2060 Chiron', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': '5145 Pholus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Deep impact', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Comet Tempel 1', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Hubble and', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Spitzer Space Telescope', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #6: Such celebrities as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), the Siemens brothers, and the Marquis of Salisbury visited the small Norwegian exhibit booth and watched with amazement as a system of pulsating spheres and similar devices appeared to reproduce well-known electric and magnetic phenomena.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hermann von Helmholtz', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Gustav Kirchhoff', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'William Thomson', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Lord Kelvin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Siemens brothers', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Marquis of Salisbury', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Norwegian', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #7: This discovery, which earned him the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1825, was followed by another, that a rotating plate of copper tends to communicate its motion to a magnetic needle suspended over it, which he called magnetism of rotation Annales de chimie et de physique (1824), vol.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Copley Medal of the Royal Society', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'copper', 'entity': 'Chemical Element'}, {'span': 'magnetism of rotation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Annales de chimie et de physique', 'entity': 'Academic Journal'}]'

Example #8: She is awakened as a Soldier by the white cat Artemis when she is thirteen years old and instructed that she has a duty to become the beautiful warrior, Sailor V. Artemis explains that Venus and Earth are twin planets of about the same size and weight, that Venus is her mother star, and that she must protect Earth from its enemies.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artemis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Sailor V. Artemis', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #9: In the Early Modern period, scientists such as William Harvey in England and Galileo Galilei in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Galen, establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Early Modern period', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'William Harvey', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'England', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Galileo Galilei', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Italy', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Aristotle', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Galen', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #10: Knowles was heavily influenced by the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 1970s prior to the album's recording, prompting her to work with several like-minded producers and songwriters such as Jack Splash, CeeLo Green, Mark Ronson, and former Holland-Dozier-Holland member Lamont Dozier.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Knowles', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Motown Sound', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Jack Splash', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'CeeLo Green', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Mark Ronson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Holland-Dozier-Holland', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Lamont Dozier', 'entity': 'Person'}]'
