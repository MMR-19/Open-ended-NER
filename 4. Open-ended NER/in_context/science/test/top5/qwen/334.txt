Example #1: They may also use Adenosine triphosphate, Nitric oxide, and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Nitric oxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ROS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #2: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #3: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: In the early days of his laboratory he discovered a new mechanism of microRNA processing independent of Dicer that requires the catalytic activity of Argonaute 2, a type of Argonaute protein.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'microRNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Dicer', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'Argonaute 2', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Argonaute', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #5: They found seven universally clustered pathways: glycolysis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, ATP synthase, DNA polymerase, hexachlorocyclohexane degradation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and photosynthesis (Adenosine diphosphate synthesis in non plant species).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'aminoacyl-tRNA', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ATP synthase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'hexachlorocyclohexane', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'cyanoamino acid', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'photosynthesis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Adenosine diphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'
