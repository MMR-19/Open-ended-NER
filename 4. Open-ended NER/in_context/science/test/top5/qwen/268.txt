Example #1: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #2: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #3: Examples are 5-O-Methylgenistein, 5-O-Methylmyricetin or 5-O-methylquercetin, also known as azaleatin.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '5-O-Methylgenistein', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': '5-O-Methylmyricetin', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': '5-O-methylquercetin', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'azaleatin', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #4: They found seven universally clustered pathways: glycolysis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, ATP synthase, DNA polymerase, hexachlorocyclohexane degradation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and photosynthesis (Adenosine diphosphate synthesis in non plant species).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'aminoacyl-tRNA', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ATP synthase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'hexachlorocyclohexane', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'cyanoamino acid', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'photosynthesis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Adenosine diphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #5: Primary structure of calponin consists of a conserved N-terminal Calponin homology domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region that contributes to the differences among there isoforms.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'calponin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'N-terminal Calponin homology domain', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'C-terminal variable region', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
