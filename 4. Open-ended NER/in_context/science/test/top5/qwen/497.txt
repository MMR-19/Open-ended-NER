Example #1: In August 1955, Grissom was reassigned to the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grissom', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Wright-Patterson Air Force Base', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Dayton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Ohio', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: The U.S. Navy has three other facilities on the bay: Naval Station San Diego, Naval Base Point Loma at Ballast Point, which is a Nuclear Submarine base, and Naval Amphibious Base Coronado.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The U.S. Navy', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Naval Station San Diego', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Naval Base Point Loma', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Ballast Point', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Nuclear Submarine base', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Naval Amphibious Base Coronado', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #3: The Fall of Singapore in February 1942 led him to offer his services to John Madsen, the Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Sydney, and the head of the Radiophysics Laboratory at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for developing radar.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fall of Singapore', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'John Madsen', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Electrical Engineering', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Radiophysics Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Council for Scientific and Industrial Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: It contains abundant speculation about technological invention, including descriptions of a worldwide telephone network, solar power, air travel, space travel to the planets Saturn and Jupiter, and terraforming engineering projects damming the Arctic Ocean, and adjusting the Earth's (Terra) axial tilt (by the Terrestrial Axis Straightening Company).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Arctic Ocean', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #5: In 1969, Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman, a University of East London lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death, when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Shenton', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Ellis Hillman', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'University of East London', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Flat Earth Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Science Fiction Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
