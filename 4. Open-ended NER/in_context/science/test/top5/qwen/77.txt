Example #1: This minor planet was named by the discoverer in memory of English astronomers Charles Mason (1728-1786) and Jeremiah Dixon (1733-1779), who observed the 1761 transit of Venus from the Cape of Good Hope.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'minor planet', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'English', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Charles Mason', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Jeremiah Dixon', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': '1761 transit of Venus', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Cape of Good Hope', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: In 1991, John Preskill and Kip Thorne bet against Stephen Hawking that the hypothesis was FALSE.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'John Preskill', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Kip Thorne', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Stephen Hawking', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #3: From the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jan Baptist van Helmont', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Robert Boyle', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Isaac Newton', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #4: The Fall of Singapore in February 1942 led him to offer his services to John Madsen, the Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Sydney, and the head of the Radiophysics Laboratory at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for developing radar.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fall of Singapore', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'John Madsen', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Electrical Engineering', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Radiophysics Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Council for Scientific and Industrial Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: The American Breeders Association held its first meeting in 1903 to discuss the new science of genetics that arose from Charles Darwin s theory of evolution and Gregor Mendel s discoveries of the laws of inheritance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'American Breeders Association', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Charles Darwin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'theory of evolution', 'entity': 'Theory'}, {'span': 'Gregor Mendel', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
