Example #1: On migrating to the blood stream, nitrogen dioxide poisoning results in an irreversible inhibition of the Acetylcholinesterase which may lead to muscular paralysis, convulsions, bronchoconstriction, the narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchi and bronchioles) and death by asphyxia tion.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'blood stream', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'nitrogen dioxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Acetylcholinesterase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'muscular paralysis', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'convulsions', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'bronchoconstriction', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'bronchi', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'bronchioles', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'asphyxia tion', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #3: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mark C Lidwill', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Sydney', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Edgar H. Booth', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #5: Primary structure of calponin consists of a conserved N-terminal Calponin homology domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region that contributes to the differences among there isoforms.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'calponin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'N-terminal Calponin homology domain', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'C-terminal variable region', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
