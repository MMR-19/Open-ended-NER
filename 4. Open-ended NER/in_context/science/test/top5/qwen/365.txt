Example #1: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maheswari', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'chloroplasts', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'California Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert S. Bandurski', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'organelle', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: However, in November 2015, a group of Chinese scientists used the gene editing technique CRISPR / Cas9 to edit single-celled, non-viable embryos to see the effectiveness of this technique.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chinese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cas9', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: The study claimed precise CRISPR and homology-directed repair response with high accuracy and percision.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'homology-directed repair response', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: In 1970, he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Renato Dulbecco winner of 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries concerning the functional organization of the cell that were seminal events in the development of modern cell biology, In 1988 he was also elected an Honorary Member of the American-Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences (ARA).

Example #5: Lin is recognized for his contributions to stem cell research, especially for his discoveries of the Piwi / Argonaute (AGO) gene family and the Piwi-interacting RNA s (piRNAs), and for proving the stem cell niche theory.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'stem cell', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Piwi', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Argonaute', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'AGO', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Piwi-interacting RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'piRNAs', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'stem cell niche theory', 'entity': 'Theory'}]'
