Example #1: Such experiments were independently performed by Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger,
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Walther Bothe', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Hans Geiger', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #2: The most common trialkyl aluminum reagents for this transformation are Trimethylaluminium, Triethylaluminium, and sometimes Triisobutylaluminium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'trialkyl aluminum', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Trimethylaluminium', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triethylaluminium', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triisobutylaluminium', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #4: Nihonium was first reported to have been created in 2003 by a Russian-American collaboration at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, and in 2004 by a team of Japanese scientists at Riken in Wakō, Japan.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nihonium', 'entity': 'Chemical Element'}, {'span': 'Russian-American', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Joint Institute for Nuclear Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'JINR', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Dubna', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Russia', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Japanese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Riken', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Wakō', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Japan', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #5: In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mark C Lidwill', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Sydney', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Edgar H. Booth', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}]'
