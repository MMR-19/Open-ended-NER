Example #1: Primary structure of calponin consists of a conserved N-terminal Calponin homology domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region that contributes to the differences among there isoforms.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'calponin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'N-terminal Calponin homology domain', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'C-terminal variable region', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #3: They may also use Adenosine triphosphate, Nitric oxide, and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Nitric oxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ROS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #4: Other toxins with a similar mode of action to ATX-II are Scorpion toxin.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ATX-II', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Scorpion toxin', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #5: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'
