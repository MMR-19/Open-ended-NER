Example #1: Primary structure of calponin consists of a conserved N-terminal Calponin homology domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region that contributes to the differences among there isoforms.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'calponin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'N-terminal Calponin homology domain', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'C-terminal variable region', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, his lab showed how intracellular molecules such as Alpha catenin and b-catenin modulate cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'single-molecule force spectroscopy', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Alpha catenin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'b-catenin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'E-cadherin', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #3: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #5: Her laboratory has determined the structures of numerous large protein complexes that play critically important roles in immune signaling, including structures of TRAFs, Myddosome and IKK-beta in Toll-like receptor, the Inflammasome, and the synaptic Recombination-activating gene.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'TRAFs', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Myddosome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'IKK-beta', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Toll-like receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Inflammasome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'synaptic Recombination-activating gene', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
