Example #1: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: DNA methyltransferase nowiki / s) are involved in regulation of the electrophysiological landscape of the brain through methylation of CpG nowiki / s.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'electrophysiological landscape', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'methylation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CpG', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to the site and adds methyl groups to the cytosine of the CpG dinucleotides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'methyl groups', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'cytosine', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CpG dinucleotides', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: For example, H3K14 and H4K12 acetylation was found to be decreased, as well as general acetylation across histones H2B and Histone H3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'H3K14', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'H4K12 acetylation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'acetylation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'histones H2B', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Histone H3', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #5: Other silencing mechanisms include the recruitment of specialized proteins that methylate DNA such that the core promoter element is inaccessible to transcription factor s and RNA polymerase.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'silencing mechanisms', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'transcription factor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'
