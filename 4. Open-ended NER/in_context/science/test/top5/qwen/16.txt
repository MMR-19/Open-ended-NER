Example #1: Organizations such as Community Forestry International, Cool Earth, The Nature Conservancy, World Wide Fund for Nature, Conservation International, African Conservation Foundation and Greenpeace also focus on preserving forest habitats.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Community Forestry International', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Cool Earth', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'The Nature Conservancy', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'World Wide Fund for Nature', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Conservation International', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'African Conservation Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Greenpeace', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: In 1969, Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman, a University of East London lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death, when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Shenton', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Ellis Hillman', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'University of East London', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Flat Earth Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Science Fiction Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #3: After the war, he returned to research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and completed building his first mass spectrograph that he reported on in 1919 and a fellow of the Royal Society and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry the following year.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cavendish Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Cambridge', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'fellow of the Royal Society', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #4: The Fall of Singapore in February 1942 led him to offer his services to John Madsen, the Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Sydney, and the head of the Radiophysics Laboratory at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for developing radar.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fall of Singapore', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'John Madsen', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Electrical Engineering', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Radiophysics Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Council for Scientific and Industrial Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: Under the influence of the new empirical methods propounded by Sir Francis Bacon and others, a group of chemists at Oxford, Robert Boyle, Robert Hooke and John Mayow began to reshape the old alchemical traditions into a scientific discipline.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Francis Bacon', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Oxford', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert Boyle', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Robert Hooke', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'John Mayow', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
