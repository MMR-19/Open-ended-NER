Example #1: The observatory made headlines briefly with the announcement on 10 December 1983 of the discovery of an unknown object at first described as possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this solar system.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'solar system', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicist s Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Emilio Segrè', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Owen Chamberlain', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #3: Nihonium was first reported to have been created in 2003 by a Russian-American collaboration at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia, and in 2004 by a team of Japanese scientists at Riken in Wakō, Japan.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nihonium', 'entity': 'Chemical Element'}, {'span': 'Russian-American', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Joint Institute for Nuclear Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'JINR', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Dubna', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Russia', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Japanese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Riken', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Wakō', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Japan', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #4: On October 7, 2008, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics to three scientists for their work in subatomic physics symmetry breaking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'subatomic physics', 'entity': 'Discipline'}]'

Example #5: He was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1850, and his Solar Tables, compiled with the assistance of Christian Olufsen, appeared in 1854.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Copley Medal', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Royal Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Solar Tables', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Christian Olufsen', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
