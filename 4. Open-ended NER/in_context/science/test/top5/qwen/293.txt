Example #1: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maheswari', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'chloroplasts', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'California Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert S. Bandurski', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'organelle', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Still within the same PCR tube, overnight IVT reaction is assembled, including standard IVT buffer, NTPs, T7 RNA polymerase, RNase inhibitor, DMSO, etc.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'PCR tube', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'IVT reaction', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'IVT buffer', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'NTPs', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'T7 RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'RNase inhibitor', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'DMSO', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #4: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #5: In the early days of his laboratory he discovered a new mechanism of microRNA processing independent of Dicer that requires the catalytic activity of Argonaute 2, a type of Argonaute protein.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'microRNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Dicer', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'Argonaute 2', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Argonaute', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
