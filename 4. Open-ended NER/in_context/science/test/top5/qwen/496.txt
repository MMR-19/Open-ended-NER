Example #1: Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'COSMIC', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: For example, when there is a mistake in base pairing, DNA mismatch repair has a bias favoring GC pairs.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'GC pairs', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: The study claimed precise CRISPR and homology-directed repair response with high accuracy and percision.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'homology-directed repair response', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
