Example #1: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Nüsslein-Volhard was educated at the University of Tübingen where she earned a PhD in 1974 for research into Protein-DNA interaction s and the binding of RNA polymerase in Escherichia coli.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nüsslein-Volhard', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'University of Tübingen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'PhD', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Protein-DNA interaction', 'entity': 'Theory'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'Escherichia coli', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: After that, they present these peptides in complexes together with their Major histocompatibility complex molecules on their cell surface.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Major histocompatibility complex', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: Human leukocyte antigen constitutes a group of cell surface antigens also known as the Major histocompatibility complex of humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Human leukocyte antigen', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Major histocompatibility complex', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to the site and adds methyl groups to the cytosine of the CpG dinucleotides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'methyl groups', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'cytosine', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CpG dinucleotides', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
