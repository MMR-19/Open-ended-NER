Example #1: During that year, he moved to University of Würzburg and two years later, in 1869 to University of Bonn.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'University of Würzburg', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Bonn', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #2: He visited some European universities and institutions, including Cavendish Laboratory, Georg August University of Göttingen, and University of Copenhagen.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cavendish Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Georg August University of Göttingen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Copenhagen', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #3: The Fall of Singapore in February 1942 led him to offer his services to John Madsen, the Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Sydney, and the head of the Radiophysics Laboratory at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for developing radar.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fall of Singapore', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'John Madsen', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Electrical Engineering', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Radiophysics Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Council for Scientific and Industrial Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: After the war, he returned to research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and completed building his first mass spectrograph that he reported on in 1919 and a fellow of the Royal Society and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry the following year.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cavendish Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Cambridge', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'fellow of the Royal Society', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #5: There were three names on the list: Werner Heisenberg, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932, Peter Debye, who would receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936, and Richard Becker - all former students of Sommerfeld.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Werner Heisenberg', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Peter Debye', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Richard Becker', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Sommerfeld', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
