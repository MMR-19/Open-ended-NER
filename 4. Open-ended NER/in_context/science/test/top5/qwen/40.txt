Example #1: The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicist s Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Emilio Segrè', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Owen Chamberlain', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #2: Lindsay and his wife Rachel translated Hans Kramers book, The Atom and the Bohr Theory of its Structure, in 1923, Hans Kramers & amp; Helge Holst, The Atom and the Bohr Theory of its Structure: An Elementary Presentation, Gyldendal, 210pp.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lindsay', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Rachel', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hans Kramers', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'The Atom and the Bohr Theory of its Structure', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Helge Holst', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'The Atom and the Bohr Theory of its Structure: An Elementary Presentation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Gyldendal', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #3: After the war, he returned to research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and completed building his first mass spectrograph that he reported on in 1919 and a fellow of the Royal Society and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry the following year.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cavendish Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Cambridge', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'fellow of the Royal Society', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #4: From the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jan Baptist van Helmont', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Robert Boyle', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Isaac Newton', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #5: There were three names on the list: Werner Heisenberg, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932, Peter Debye, who would receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936, and Richard Becker - all former students of Sommerfeld.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Werner Heisenberg', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Peter Debye', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Richard Becker', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Sommerfeld', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
