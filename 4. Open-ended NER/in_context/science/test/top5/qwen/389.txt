Example #1: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Lin is recognized for his contributions to stem cell research, especially for his discoveries of the Piwi / Argonaute (AGO) gene family and the Piwi-interacting RNA s (piRNAs), and for proving the stem cell niche theory.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'stem cell', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Piwi', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Argonaute', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'AGO', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Piwi-interacting RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'piRNAs', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'stem cell niche theory', 'entity': 'Theory'}]'

Example #4: Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'COSMIC', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maheswari', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'chloroplasts', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'California Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert S. Bandurski', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'organelle', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
