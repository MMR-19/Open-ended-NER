Example #2: There were three names on the list: Werner Heisenberg, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932, Peter Debye, who would receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936, and Richard Becker - all former students of Sommerfeld.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Werner Heisenberg', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Peter Debye', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Richard Becker', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Sommerfeld', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #3: Two pairs of fathers and sons have won Nobel Prizes in other fields: Hans von Euler-Chelpin (chemistry, 1929) and Ulf von Euler (medicine, 1970); and Arthur Kornberg (medicine, 1969) and Roger D. Kornberg (chemistry, 2006).

Example #4: In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mark C Lidwill', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Sydney', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Edgar H. Booth', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #5: The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicist s Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Emilio Segrè', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Owen Chamberlain', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}]'
