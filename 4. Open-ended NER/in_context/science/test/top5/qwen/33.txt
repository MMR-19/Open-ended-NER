Example #1: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: Human leukocyte antigen constitutes a group of cell surface antigens also known as the Major histocompatibility complex of humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Human leukocyte antigen', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Major histocompatibility complex', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Lin is recognized for his contributions to stem cell research, especially for his discoveries of the Piwi / Argonaute (AGO) gene family and the Piwi-interacting RNA s (piRNAs), and for proving the stem cell niche theory.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'stem cell', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Piwi', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Argonaute', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'AGO', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Piwi-interacting RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'piRNAs', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'stem cell niche theory', 'entity': 'Theory'}]'

Example #4: Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'COSMIC', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: In the early days of his laboratory he discovered a new mechanism of microRNA processing independent of Dicer that requires the catalytic activity of Argonaute 2, a type of Argonaute protein.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'microRNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Dicer', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'Argonaute 2', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Argonaute', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
