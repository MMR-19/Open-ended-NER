Example #1: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #3: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to the site and adds methyl groups to the cytosine of the CpG dinucleotides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'methyl groups', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'cytosine', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CpG dinucleotides', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: H3K9me3 is an epigenetic modification to the DNA packaging protein Histone H3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'H3K9me3', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'epigenetic modification', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Histone H3', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #5: Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'COSMIC', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
