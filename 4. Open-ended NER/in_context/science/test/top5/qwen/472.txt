Example #4: This is due to the gravitation influence of Saturn and Jupiter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #5: It will use the gravity assist technique with Earth once, with Venus twice, and six times with Mercury.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Mercury', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'
