Example #1: In 1970, he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Renato Dulbecco winner of 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries concerning the functional organization of the cell that were seminal events in the development of modern cell biology, In 1988 he was also elected an Honorary Member of the American-Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences (ARA).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Columbia University', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Renato Dulbecco', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'cell biology', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'American-Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ARA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5 to 3 direction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA replication', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA primers', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #3: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maheswari', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'chloroplasts', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'California Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert S.
