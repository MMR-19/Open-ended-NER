Example #1: Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation is an immediate DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification of Histone and other nuclear proteins that contributes to the survival of injured proliferating cells.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Histone', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'nuclear proteins', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5 to 3 direction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA replication', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA primers', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #4: For example, when there is a mistake in base pairing, DNA mismatch repair has a bias favoring GC pairs.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'GC pairs', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'COSMIC', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
