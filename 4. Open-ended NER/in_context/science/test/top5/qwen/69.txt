Example #1: The American Breeders Association held its first meeting in 1903 to discuss the new science of genetics that arose from Charles Darwin s theory of evolution and Gregor Mendel s discoveries of the laws of inheritance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'American Breeders Association', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Charles Darwin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'theory of evolution', 'entity': 'Theory'}, {'span': 'Gregor Mendel', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #2: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maheswari', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'chloroplasts', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'California Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert S. Bandurski', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'organelle', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: From the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jan Baptist van Helmont', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Robert Boyle', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Isaac Newton', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #4: The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicist s Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Emilio Segrè', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Owen Chamberlain', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #5: There were three names on the list: Werner Heisenberg, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932, Peter Debye, who would receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936, and Richard Becker - all former students of Sommerfeld.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Werner Heisenberg', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Peter Debye', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Richard Becker', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Sommerfeld', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
