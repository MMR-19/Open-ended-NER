Example #1: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #2: They may also use Adenosine triphosphate, Nitric oxide, and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Nitric oxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ROS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #3: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: The widely used iGluSnFR consists of a circularly permuted Green fluorescent protein fused to a glutamate binding protein (GluBP) from a bacterium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'iGluSnFR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Green fluorescent protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'glutamate binding protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'GluBP', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
