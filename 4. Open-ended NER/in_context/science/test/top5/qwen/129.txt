Example #1: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: This increased DctA expression, they found, permitted Citsup + / sup cells to re-uptake Succinic acid, Malic acid, and Fumaric acid released into the medium by the CitT transporter during import of citrate.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DctA', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Succinic acid', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Malic acid', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Fumaric acid', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CitT', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'citrate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #4: Human leukocyte antigen constitutes a group of cell surface antigens also known as the Major histocompatibility complex of humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Human leukocyte antigen', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Major histocompatibility complex', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: Her laboratory has determined the structures of numerous large protein complexes that play critically important roles in immune signaling, including structures of TRAFs, Myddosome and IKK-beta in Toll-like receptor, the Inflammasome, and the synaptic Recombination-activating gene.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'TRAFs', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Myddosome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'IKK-beta', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Toll-like receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Inflammasome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'synaptic Recombination-activating gene', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
