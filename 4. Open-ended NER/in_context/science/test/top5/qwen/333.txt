Example #1: He was awarded the Copley Medal by the Royal Society in 1850, and his Solar Tables, compiled with the assistance of Christian Olufsen, appeared in 1854.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Copley Medal', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Royal Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Solar Tables', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Christian Olufsen', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #2: After the war, he returned to research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and completed building his first mass spectrograph that he reported on in 1919 and a fellow of the Royal Society and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry the following year.

Example #3: In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mark C Lidwill', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Sydney', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Edgar H. Booth', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #4: Such celebrities as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), the Siemens brothers, and the Marquis of Salisbury visited the small Norwegian exhibit booth and watched with amazement as a system of pulsating spheres and similar devices appeared to reproduce well-known electric and magnetic phenomena.

Example #5: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
