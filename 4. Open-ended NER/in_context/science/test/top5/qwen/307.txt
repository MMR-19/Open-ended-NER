Example #1: The study claimed precise CRISPR and homology-directed repair response with high accuracy and percision.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'homology-directed repair response', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: However, in November 2015, a group of Chinese scientists used the gene editing technique CRISPR / Cas9 to edit single-celled, non-viable embryos to see the effectiveness of this technique.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chinese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cas9', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation is an immediate DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification of Histone and other nuclear proteins that contributes to the survival of injured proliferating cells.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Histone', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'nuclear proteins', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'COSMIC', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
