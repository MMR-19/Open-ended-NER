Example #1: Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, his lab showed how intracellular molecules such as Alpha catenin and b-catenin modulate cell-cell adhesion mediated by E-cadherin.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'single-molecule force spectroscopy', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Alpha catenin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'b-catenin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'E-cadherin', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS detergent, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'lipid bilayer', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'SDS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triton X-100', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'X-114', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CHAPS detergent', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'DOC', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'NP-40', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #3: They may also use Adenosine triphosphate, Nitric oxide, and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Nitric oxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ROS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #4: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #5: Other toxins with a similar mode of action to ATX-II are Scorpion toxin.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ATX-II', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Scorpion toxin', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
