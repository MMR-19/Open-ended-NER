Example #1: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: DNA methyltransferase nowiki / s) are involved in regulation of the electrophysiological landscape of the brain through methylation of CpG nowiki / s.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'electrophysiological landscape', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'methylation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CpG', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: They may also use Adenosine triphosphate, Nitric oxide, and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Nitric oxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ROS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #4: Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation is an immediate DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification of Histone and other nuclear proteins that contributes to the survival of injured proliferating cells.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Histone', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'nuclear proteins', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #5: Several scholars including Steven Pinker, Chomsky, Gerald Edelman, and Alexander Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higher-order consciousness.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Steven Pinker', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Chomsky', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Gerald Edelman', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Alexander Luria', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'higher-order consciousness', 'entity': 'Theory'}]'
