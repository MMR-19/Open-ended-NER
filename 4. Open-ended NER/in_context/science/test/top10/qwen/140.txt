Example #4: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.

Example #5: Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS detergent, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'lipid bilayer', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'SDS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triton X-100', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'X-114', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CHAPS detergent', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'DOC', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'NP-40', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #6: The exceptions are Venus and Uranus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Uranus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #7: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'enzymology', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'Rieske protein non-heme iron oxygenases', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'Alcohol dehydrogenase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #9: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #10: Her laboratory has determined the structures of numerous large protein complexes that play critically important roles in immune signaling, including structures of TRAFs, Myddosome and IKK-beta in Toll-like receptor, the Inflammasome, and the synaptic Recombination-activating gene.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'TRAFs', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Myddosome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'IKK-beta', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Toll-like receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Inflammasome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'synaptic Recombination-activating gene', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
