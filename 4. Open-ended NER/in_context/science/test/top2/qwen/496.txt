Example #1: Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'COSMIC', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: For example, when there is a mistake in base pairing, DNA mismatch repair has a bias favoring GC pairs.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'GC pairs', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
