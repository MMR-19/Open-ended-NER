Example #1: From the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jan Baptist van Helmont', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Robert Boyle', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Isaac Newton', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #2: There were three names on the list: Werner Heisenberg, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932, Peter Debye, who would receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936, and Richard Becker - all former students of Sommerfeld.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Werner Heisenberg', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Peter Debye', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Richard Becker', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Sommerfeld', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
