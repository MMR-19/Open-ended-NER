Example #1: The observatory made headlines briefly with the announcement on 10 December 1983 of the discovery of an unknown object at first described as possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this solar system.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'solar system', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by University of California, Berkeley physicist s Emilio Segrè and Owen Chamberlain, for which they were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'University of California, Berkeley', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Emilio Segrè', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Owen Chamberlain', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Physics', 'entity': 'Award'}]'
