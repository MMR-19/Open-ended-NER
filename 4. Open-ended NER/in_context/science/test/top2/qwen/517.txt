Example #1: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #2: They may also use Adenosine triphosphate, Nitric oxide, and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Nitric oxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ROS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'
