Example #1: However, in November 2015, a group of Chinese scientists used the gene editing technique CRISPR / Cas9 to edit single-celled, non-viable embryos to see the effectiveness of this technique.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chinese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cas9', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: The study claimed precise CRISPR and homology-directed repair response with high accuracy and percision.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'homology-directed repair response', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
