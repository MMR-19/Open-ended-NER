Example #1: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
