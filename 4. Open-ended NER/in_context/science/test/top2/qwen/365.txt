Example #1: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maheswari', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'chloroplasts', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'California Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert S. Bandurski', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'organelle', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: However, in November 2015, a group of Chinese scientists used the gene editing technique CRISPR / Cas9 to edit single-celled, non-viable embryos to see the effectiveness of this technique.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chinese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cas9', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
