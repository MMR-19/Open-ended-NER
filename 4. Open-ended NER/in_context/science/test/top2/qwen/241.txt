Example #1: CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-9b have already been observed by Spitzer.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CoRoT-7b', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'CoRoT-9b', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Spitzer', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: The observatory made headlines briefly with the announcement on 10 December 1983 of the discovery of an unknown object at first described as possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this solar system.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'solar system', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
