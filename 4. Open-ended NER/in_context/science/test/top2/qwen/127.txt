Example #1: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: For example, when there is a mistake in base pairing, DNA mismatch repair has a bias favoring GC pairs.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'GC pairs', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
