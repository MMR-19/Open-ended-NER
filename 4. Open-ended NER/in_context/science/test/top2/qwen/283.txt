Example #1: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Other silencing mechanisms include the recruitment of specialized proteins that methylate DNA such that the core promoter element is inaccessible to transcription factor s and RNA polymerase.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'silencing mechanisms', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'transcription factor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'
