Example #1: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
