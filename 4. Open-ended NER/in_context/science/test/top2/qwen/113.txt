Example #1: In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5 to 3 direction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA replication', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA primers', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #2: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
