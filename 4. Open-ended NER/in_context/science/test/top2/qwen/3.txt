Example #1: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'
