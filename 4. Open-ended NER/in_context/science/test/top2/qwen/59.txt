Example #2: After the war, he returned to research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and completed building his first mass spectrograph that he reported on in 1919 and a fellow of the Royal Society and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry the following year.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cavendish Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Cambridge', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'fellow of the Royal Society', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}]'
