Example #1: The American Breeders Association held its first meeting in 1903 to discuss the new science of genetics that arose from Charles Darwin s theory of evolution and Gregor Mendel s discoveries of the laws of inheritance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'American Breeders Association', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Charles Darwin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'theory of evolution', 'entity': 'Theory'}, {'span': 'Gregor Mendel', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #2: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maheswari', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'chloroplasts', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'California Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert S. Bandurski', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'organelle', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
