Example #1: Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation is an immediate DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification of Histone and other nuclear proteins that contributes to the survival of injured proliferating cells.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA damage-dependent post-translational modification', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Histone', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'nuclear proteins', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate has also been shown to inhibit the lsr operon through Cyclic adenosine monophosphate -CAPK-mediated inhibition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'lsr operon', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'
