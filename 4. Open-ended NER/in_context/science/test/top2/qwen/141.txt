Example #1: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to DNA during its replication, or during DNA repair.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: DNA methyltransferase is recruited to the site and adds methyl groups to the cytosine of the CpG dinucleotides.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'methyl groups', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'cytosine', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CpG dinucleotides', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
