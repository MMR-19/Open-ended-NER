Example #1: The observatory made headlines briefly with the announcement on 10 December 1983 of the discovery of an unknown object at first described as possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this solar system.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Earth', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'solar system', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Such celebrities as Hermann von Helmholtz, Gustav Kirchhoff, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), the Siemens brothers, and the Marquis of Salisbury visited the small Norwegian exhibit booth and watched with amazement as a system of pulsating spheres and similar devices appeared to reproduce well-known electric and magnetic phenomena.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hermann von Helmholtz', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Gustav Kirchhoff', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'William Thomson', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Lord Kelvin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'Siemens brothers', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Marquis of Salisbury', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Norwegian', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
