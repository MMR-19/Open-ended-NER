Example #1: The WHO, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the British Medical Association, and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain recommend routine vaccination of children against mumps.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'WHO', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'American Academy of Pediatrics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'American Academy of Family Physicians', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'British Medical Association', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'mumps', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS detergent, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'lipid bilayer', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'SDS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triton X-100', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'X-114', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CHAPS detergent', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'DOC', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'NP-40', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'
