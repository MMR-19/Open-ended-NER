Example #1: He is well known for his structural enzymology work on Rieske protein non-heme iron oxygenases and Alcohol dehydrogenase
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'enzymology', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'Rieske protein non-heme iron oxygenases', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'Alcohol dehydrogenase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #2: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
