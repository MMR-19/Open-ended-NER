Example #1: The journal establishment was similar to the starting of The Astrophysical Journal and The Astronomical Journal by George Ellery Hale.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The Astrophysical Journal', 'entity': 'Academic Journal'}, {'span': 'The Astronomical Journal', 'entity': 'Academic Journal'}, {'span': 'George Ellery Hale', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'

Example #2: In 1969, Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman, a University of East London lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death, when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Shenton', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Ellis Hillman', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'University of East London', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Flat Earth Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Science Fiction Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
