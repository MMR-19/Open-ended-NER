Example #1: Her laboratory has determined the structures of numerous large protein complexes that play critically important roles in immune signaling, including structures of TRAFs, Myddosome and IKK-beta in Toll-like receptor, the Inflammasome, and the synaptic Recombination-activating gene.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'TRAFs', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Myddosome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'IKK-beta', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Toll-like receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Inflammasome', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'synaptic Recombination-activating gene', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #2: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'
