Example #1: Several genes known to be affected by differential methylation are the CYP1A1 xenobiotic response element, Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor, and F2RL3.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CYP1A1', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'F2RL3', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: DNA methyltransferase nowiki / s) are involved in regulation of the electrophysiological landscape of the brain through methylation of CpG nowiki / s.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'electrophysiological landscape', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'methylation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CpG', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
