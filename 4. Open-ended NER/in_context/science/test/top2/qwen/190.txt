Example #1: One of the first significant contributions of Maheswari was the discovery of RNA polymerase activity in chloroplasts which he accomplished during his early stint at California Institute of Technology while working with Robert S. Bandurski and their researches revealed the presence of DNA in organelle.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maheswari', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'chloroplasts', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'California Institute of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Robert S. Bandurski', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'organelle', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: The study claimed precise CRISPR and homology-directed repair response with high accuracy and percision.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'homology-directed repair response', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
