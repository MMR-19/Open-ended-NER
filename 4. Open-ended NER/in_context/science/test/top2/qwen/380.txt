Example #1: Primary structure of calponin consists of a conserved N-terminal Calponin homology domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region that contributes to the differences among there isoforms.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'calponin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'N-terminal Calponin homology domain', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'C-terminal variable region', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: In 1926, Mark C Lidwill of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the University of Sydney, devised a portable apparatus which plugged into a lighting point and in which One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution while the other pole consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Mark C Lidwill', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Royal Prince Alfred Hospital', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Sydney', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Edgar H. Booth', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'University of Sydney', 'entity': 'University'}]'
