Example #8: On migrating to the blood stream, nitrogen dioxide poisoning results in an irreversible inhibition of the Acetylcholinesterase which may lead to muscular paralysis, convulsions, bronchoconstriction, the narrowing of the airways in the lungs (bronchi and bronchioles) and death by asphyxia tion.
