Example #1: Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'COSMIC', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA mismatch repair', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: He was the first to identify the biological role of the non-structural NS1 Influenza Protein during infection, the first to describe and provide a molecular analysis of a viral-encoded Interferon antagonist among negative strand RNA viruses, and the first to demonstrate that the M1 protein of the influenza virus determines its morphology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NS1 Influenza Protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'RNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'M1 protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #3: Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor is known to inhibit the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, which is important to metabolizing harmful chemicals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'aryl hydrocarbon receptor', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #4: The exceptions are Venus and Uranus.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Venus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Uranus', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #5: The study claimed precise CRISPR and homology-directed repair response with high accuracy and percision.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'homology-directed repair response', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #6: In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5 to 3 direction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA replication', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA primers', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #7: DNA methyltransferase nowiki / s) are involved in regulation of the electrophysiological landscape of the brain through methylation of CpG nowiki / s.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA methyltransferase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'electrophysiological landscape', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'methylation', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CpG', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #8: Lost was created by Jeffrey Lieber, J. J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, who share story writing credits for the pilot episode, which Abrams directed.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lost', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Jeffrey Lieber', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'J. J. Abrams', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Damon Lindelof', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'pilot episode', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Abrams', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #9: Human leukocyte antigen constitutes a group of cell surface antigens also known as the Major histocompatibility complex of humans.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Human leukocyte antigen', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Major histocompatibility complex', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #10: The American Breeders Association held its first meeting in 1903 to discuss the new science of genetics that arose from Charles Darwin s theory of evolution and Gregor Mendel s discoveries of the laws of inheritance.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'American Breeders Association', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Charles Darwin', 'entity': 'Scientist'}, {'span': 'theory of evolution', 'entity': 'Theory'}, {'span': 'Gregor Mendel', 'entity': 'Scientist'}]'
