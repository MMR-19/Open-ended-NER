Example #2: In 1969, Shenton persuaded Ellis Hillman, a University of East London lecturer, to become president of the Flat Earth Society; but there is little evidence of any activity on his part until after Shenton's death, when he added most of Shenton's library to the archives of the Science Fiction Foundation he helped to establish.

Example #7: However, in November 2015, a group of Chinese scientists used the gene editing technique CRISPR / Cas9 to edit single-celled, non-viable embryos to see the effectiveness of this technique.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chinese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cas9', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #8: Ubiquitin ligase are proteins that assist in tagging their targets with an epigenetic mark known as ubiquitin.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ubiquitin ligase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'ubiquitin', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #9: For example, H3K14 and H4K12 acetylation was found to be decreased, as well as general acetylation across histones H2B and Histone H3.
