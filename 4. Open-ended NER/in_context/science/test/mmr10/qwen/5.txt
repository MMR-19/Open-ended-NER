Example #3: In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5 to 3 direction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA replication', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA primers', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #4: While geodesy and geophysics are separate fields, the two are so closely connected that many scientific organizations such as the American Geophysical Union, the Canadian Geophysical Union and the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics encompass both.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'geodesy', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'geophysics', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'American Geophysical Union', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Canadian Geophysical Union', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: Other silencing mechanisms include the recruitment of specialized proteins that methylate DNA such that the core promoter element is inaccessible to transcription factor s and RNA polymerase.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'silencing mechanisms', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'transcription factor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #6: Primary structure of calponin consists of a conserved N-terminal Calponin homology domain, a conserved middle region containing two actin-binding sites, and a C-terminal variable region that contributes to the differences among there isoforms.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'calponin', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'N-terminal Calponin homology domain', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'C-terminal variable region', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #7: However, in November 2015, a group of Chinese scientists used the gene editing technique CRISPR / Cas9 to edit single-celled, non-viable embryos to see the effectiveness of this technique.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Chinese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'CRISPR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Cas9', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #8: Yunjin Kim played Sun-Hwa Kwon, the daughter of a powerful and incredibly wealthy Korean businessman and mobster, with Daniel Dae Kim as her husband and father's enforcer Jin-Soo Kwon.
