Example #1: Detergents are key reagents to extract protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipid bilayer (SDS, Triton X-100, X-114, CHAPS detergent, DOC, and NP-40), and solubilize proteins.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'lipid bilayer', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'SDS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Triton X-100', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'X-114', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'CHAPS detergent', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'DOC', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'NP-40', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #2: She represented her country at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics without reaching the semifinals.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2017 World Championships in Athletics', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #3: In DNA replication, RNA primers must be inserted along the lagging strand so that DNA polymerase is able to synthesize the strand in the 5 to 3 direction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DNA replication', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'RNA primers', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DNA polymerase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #4: They may also use Adenosine triphosphate, Nitric oxide, and ROS for signaling in the same ways that animals do.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adenosine triphosphate', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'Nitric oxide', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}, {'span': 'ROS', 'entity': 'Chemical Compound'}]'

Example #5: The widely used iGluSnFR consists of a circularly permuted Green fluorescent protein fused to a glutamate binding protein (GluBP) from a bacterium.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'iGluSnFR', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Green fluorescent protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'glutamate binding protein', 'entity': 'Protein'}, {'span': 'GluBP', 'entity': 'Protein'}]'

Example #6: After the war, he returned to research at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and completed building his first mass spectrograph that he reported on in 1919 and a fellow of the Royal Society and received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry the following year.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cavendish Laboratory', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Cambridge', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'fellow of the Royal Society', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Chemistry', 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #7: The orbit of 70 Panopaea places it in a mean motion resonance with the planets Jupiter and Saturn.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '70 Panopaea', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Jupiter', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}, {'span': 'Saturn', 'entity': 'Astronomical Object'}]'

Example #8: He described Bleach's portrayal as a halfway house between the original version as played by Michael Wisher and the more exuberant ... turn by Terry Molloy.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Michael Wisher', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Terry Molloy', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #9: He is well known for his structural enzymology work on Rieske protein non-heme iron oxygenases and Alcohol dehydrogenase
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'enzymology', 'entity': 'Discipline'}, {'span': 'Rieske protein non-heme iron oxygenases', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}, {'span': 'Alcohol dehydrogenase', 'entity': 'Enzyme'}]'

Example #10: Lost was created by Jeffrey Lieber, J. J. Abrams and Damon Lindelof, who share story writing credits for the pilot episode, which Abrams directed.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lost', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Jeffrey Lieber', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'J. J. Abrams', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Damon Lindelof', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'pilot episode', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Abrams', 'entity': 'Person'}]'
