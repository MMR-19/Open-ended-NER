Example #1: In 2012, when the Nobel Prize Records were opened after 50 years, it was revealed that Durrell had been on a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with American John Steinbeck (winner), British poet Robert Graves, French writer Jean Anouilh, and the Danish Karen Blixen.

Example #2: In 1927 Lu was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, for the short story The TRUE Story of Ah Q, despite a poor English translation and annotations that were nearly double the size of the text. Kowallis 3 Lu rejected the possibility of accepting the nomination.

Example #3: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'classic', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Aulus Gellius', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Ancient Rome', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Noctes Atticae', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'classicus scriptor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'non proletarius', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: During most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: Down and Out in Paris and London (describing a period of poverty in these cities), The Road to Wigan Pier (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and Homage to Catalonia.

Example #6: Another Gruelle family friends was Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, whose poems The Elf-Child, later titled Little Orphant Annie! -- Orphant is correct -- not the comic strip-- (1885), and The Raggedy Man (1888), eventually formed the name for John Gruelle's iconic Raggedy Ann character.

Example #10: Caterina di Giacomo di Benincasa was born on 25 March 1347 (shortly before the Black Death ravaged Europe) in Siena, Republic of Siena (today Italy), to Lapa Piagenti, the daughter of a local poet, and Giacomo di Benincasa, a cloth dyer who ran his enterprise with the help of his sons.
