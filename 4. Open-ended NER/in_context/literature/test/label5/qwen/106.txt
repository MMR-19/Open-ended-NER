Example #1: This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maure ' s Roman de Troie and Guido delle Colonne ' s Historia destructionis Troiae, which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century.

Example #2: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.

Le Guin ' s 1969 The Left Hand of Darkness, which won both the 1969 Nebula Award for Best Novel and 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel awards for best science fiction novel, arguing that gender discriminations that permeated science fiction by men showed up just as frequently in science fiction by women.

Le Guin', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'The Left Hand of Darkness', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Nebula Award for Best Novel', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Hugo Award for Best Novel', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'science fiction', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}]'
