Example #2: In 1927 Lu was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, for the short story The TRUE Story of Ah Q, despite a poor English translation and annotations that were nearly double the size of the text. Kowallis 3 Lu rejected the possibility of accepting the nomination.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lu', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Literature', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'short story', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'The TRUE Story of Ah Q', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'English', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Kowallis 3 Lu', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #5: Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize -winning biographer, A. Scott Berg, contended that Lindbergh was not so much a supporter of the Nazi regime as someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lindbergh', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Pulitzer Prize', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'A. Scott Berg', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Nazi', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
