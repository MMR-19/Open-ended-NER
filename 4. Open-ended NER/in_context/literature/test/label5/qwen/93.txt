Example #1: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).

Le Guin ' s 1969 The Left Hand of Darkness, which won both the 1969 Nebula Award for Best Novel and 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel awards for best science fiction novel, arguing that gender discriminations that permeated science fiction by men showed up just as frequently in science fiction by women.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Russ', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Ursula K. Le Guin', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'The Left Hand of Darkness', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Nebula Award for Best Novel', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Hugo Award for Best Novel', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'science fiction', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}]'

Example #3: Another Gruelle family friends was Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, whose poems The Elf-Child, later titled Little Orphant Annie! -- Orphant is correct -- not the comic strip-- (1885), and The Raggedy Man (1888), eventually formed the name for John Gruelle's iconic Raggedy Ann character.
