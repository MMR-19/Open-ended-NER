Example #3: Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize -winning biographer, A. Scott Berg, contended that Lindbergh was not so much a supporter of the Nazi regime as someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one.

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'classic', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Aulus Gellius', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Ancient Rome', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Noctes Atticae', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'classicus scriptor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'non proletarius', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
