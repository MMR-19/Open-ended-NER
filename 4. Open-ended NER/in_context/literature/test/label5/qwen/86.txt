Example #1: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nobel Prize Records', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Durrell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Literature', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'American', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'John Steinbeck', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'British', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Robert Graves', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'French', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Jean Anouilh', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Danish', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Karen Blixen', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #3: During most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: Down and Out in Paris and London (describing a period of poverty in these cities), The Road to Wigan Pier (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and Homage to Catalonia.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Orwell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Down and Out in Paris and London', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'The Road to Wigan Pier', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'England', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Homage to Catalonia', 'entity': 'Book'}]'

Example #4: For example, Russ criticized Ursula K. Le Guin ' s 1969 The Left Hand of Darkness, which won both the 1969 Nebula Award for Best Novel and 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel awards for best science fiction novel, arguing that gender discriminations that permeated science fiction by men showed up just as frequently in science fiction by women.

Le Guin', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'The Left Hand of Darkness', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Nebula Award for Best Novel', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Hugo Award for Best Novel', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'science fiction', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}]'

Example #5: Another Gruelle family friends was Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, whose poems The Elf-Child, later titled Little Orphant Annie! -- Orphant is correct -- not the comic strip-- (1885), and The Raggedy Man (1888), eventually formed the name for John Gruelle's iconic Raggedy Ann character.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Gruelle', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hoosier poet', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'James Whitcomb Riley', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'The Elf-Child', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Little Orphant Annie', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'The Raggedy Man', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'John Gruelle', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Raggedy Ann', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
