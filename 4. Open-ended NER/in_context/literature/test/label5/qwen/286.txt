Example #1: The poems he had written during his time in prison were so effective that Dudley Randall, a poet and owner of Broadside Press, published Knight's first volume of verse, Poems from Prison, and hailed Knight as one of the major poets of the Black Arts Movement.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Dudley Randall', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Broadside Press', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': "Knight's first volume of verse", 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Poems from Prison', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Black Arts Movement', 'entity': 'Event'}]'

Example #2: According to Willmott, Yeats's poems often move from the world of social interaction to a place where the individual finds seclusion, as is also the case in the pastoral Yeats's earlier poems The Lake Isle of Innisfree, The Song of the Happy Shepherd, and The Sad Shepherd.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Willmott', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Yeats', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'The Song of the Happy Shepherd', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'The Sad Shepherd', 'entity': 'Poem'}]'

Example #3: Another Gruelle family friends was Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, whose poems The Elf-Child, later titled Little Orphant Annie! -- Orphant is correct -- not the comic strip-- (1885), and The Raggedy Man (1888), eventually formed the name for John Gruelle's iconic Raggedy Ann character.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Gruelle', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hoosier poet', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'James Whitcomb Riley', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'The Elf-Child', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Little Orphant Annie', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'The Raggedy Man', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'John Gruelle', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Raggedy Ann', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Renaissance poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'On My First Sonne', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Celia', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Penshurst', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Salomon Pavy', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #5: A late (1890s) reference to the urban legend of the murderous barber can be found in the poem by the Australian bush poet Banjo Paterson - The Man from Ironbark.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'poem', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Australian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Banjo Paterson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'The Man from Ironbark', 'entity': 'Poem'}]'
