Example #1: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Orwell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Down and Out in Paris and London', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'The Road to Wigan Pier', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'England', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Homage to Catalonia', 'entity': 'Book'}]'

Example #3: In 2012, when the Nobel Prize Records were opened after 50 years, it was revealed that Durrell had been on a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with American John Steinbeck (winner), British poet Robert Graves, French writer Jean Anouilh, and the Danish Karen Blixen.
