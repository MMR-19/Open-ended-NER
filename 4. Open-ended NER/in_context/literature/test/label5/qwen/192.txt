Example #1: For example, Russ criticized Ursula K. Le Guin ' s 1969 The Left Hand of Darkness, which won both the 1969 Nebula Award for Best Novel and 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel awards for best science fiction novel, arguing that gender discriminations that permeated science fiction by men showed up just as frequently in science fiction by women.
