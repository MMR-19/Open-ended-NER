Example #1: For example, Russ criticized Ursula K. Le Guin ' s 1969 The Left Hand of Darkness, which won both the 1969 Nebula Award for Best Novel and 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novel awards for best science fiction novel, arguing that gender discriminations that permeated science fiction by men showed up just as frequently in science fiction by women.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Russ', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Ursula K. Le Guin', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'The Left Hand of Darkness', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Nebula Award for Best Novel', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Hugo Award for Best Novel', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'science fiction', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}]'

Example #2: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Renaissance poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'On My First Sonne', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Celia', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Penshurst', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Salomon Pavy', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #3: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers - from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell, G. K. Chesterton, and Tom Wolfe - for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Dickens', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Leo Tolstoy', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'George Orwell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'G. K. Chesterton', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Tom Wolfe', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #5: Fry helped to fund a 1988 London re-staging of Stanshall's Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera, written by Vivian and Ki Longfellow for the Bristol -based The Thekla.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fry', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'London', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Stanshall', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Vivian', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Ki Longfellow', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Bristol', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'The Thekla', 'entity': 'Location'}]'
