Example #1: In 2012, when the Nobel Prize Records were opened after 50 years, it was revealed that Durrell had been on a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with American John Steinbeck (winner), British poet Robert Graves, French writer Jean Anouilh, and the Danish Karen Blixen.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nobel Prize Records', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Durrell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Literature', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'American', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'John Steinbeck', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'British', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Robert Graves', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'French', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Jean Anouilh', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Danish', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Karen Blixen', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #2: During most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: Down and Out in Paris and London (describing a period of poverty in these cities), The Road to Wigan Pier (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and Homage to Catalonia.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Orwell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Down and Out in Paris and London', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'The Road to Wigan Pier', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'England', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Homage to Catalonia', 'entity': 'Book'}]'

Example #3: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Renaissance poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'On My First Sonne', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Celia', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Penshurst', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Salomon Pavy', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #4: Due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his Foundation series, he did so with Foundation's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1992), his last novel.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Asimov', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Foundation series', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': "Foundation's Edge", 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Foundation and Earth', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'trilogy', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Prelude to Foundation', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Forward the Foundation', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'novel', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}]'

Example #5: Under the influence of Adrian Maniu, the adolescent Tzara became interested in Symbolism and co-founded the magazine Simbolul with Ion Vinea (with whom he also wrote experimental poetry) and painter Marcel Janco.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Adrian Maniu', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Tzara', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Symbolism', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Simbolul', 'entity': 'Magazine'}, {'span': 'Ion Vinea', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'experimental poetry', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Marcel Janco', 'entity': 'Person'}]'
