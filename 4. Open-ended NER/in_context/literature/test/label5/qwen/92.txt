Example #1: During most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: Down and Out in Paris and London (describing a period of poverty in these cities), The Road to Wigan Pier (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and Homage to Catalonia.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Orwell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Down and Out in Paris and London', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'The Road to Wigan Pier', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'England', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Homage to Catalonia', 'entity': 'Book'}]'

Example #2: Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers - from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell, G. K. Chesterton, and Tom Wolfe - for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Dickens', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Leo Tolstoy', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'George Orwell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'G. K. Chesterton', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Tom Wolfe', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #3: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: Fry helped to fund a 1988 London re-staging of Stanshall's Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera, written by Vivian and Ki Longfellow for the Bristol -based The Thekla.

Example #5: Lindbergh's Pulitzer Prize -winning biographer, A. Scott Berg, contended that Lindbergh was not so much a supporter of the Nazi regime as someone so stubborn in his convictions and relatively inexperienced in political maneuvering that he easily allowed rivals to portray him as one.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lindbergh', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Pulitzer Prize', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'A. Scott Berg', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Nazi', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
