Example #2: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.
