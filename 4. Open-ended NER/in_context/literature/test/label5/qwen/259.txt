Example #1: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: During most of his career, Orwell was best known for his journalism, in essays, reviews, columns in newspapers and magazines and in his books of reportage: Down and Out in Paris and London (describing a period of poverty in these cities), The Road to Wigan Pier (describing the living conditions of the poor in northern England, and class division generally) and Homage to Catalonia.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Orwell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Down and Out in Paris and London', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'The Road to Wigan Pier', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'England', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Homage to Catalonia', 'entity': 'Book'}]'

Example #3: Due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his Foundation series, he did so with Foundation's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1992), his last novel.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Asimov', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Foundation series', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': "Foundation's Edge", 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Foundation and Earth', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'trilogy', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Prelude to Foundation', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Forward the Foundation', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'novel', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}]'

Example #4: Fry helped to fund a 1988 London re-staging of Stanshall's Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera, written by Vivian and Ki Longfellow for the Bristol -based The Thekla.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fry', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'London', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Stanshall', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Vivian', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Ki Longfellow', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Bristol', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'The Thekla', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: Another Gruelle family friends was Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley, whose poems The Elf-Child, later titled Little Orphant Annie! -- Orphant is correct -- not the comic strip-- (1885), and The Raggedy Man (1888), eventually formed the name for John Gruelle's iconic Raggedy Ann character.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Gruelle', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hoosier poet', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'James Whitcomb Riley', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'The Elf-Child', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Little Orphant Annie', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'The Raggedy Man', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'John Gruelle', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Raggedy Ann', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
