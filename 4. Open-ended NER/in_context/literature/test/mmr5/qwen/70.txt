Example #1: He also gave a lecture at the Beethovensaal in Berlin on 13 October 1922, which appeared in Neue Rundschau in November 1922 in which he developed his eccentric defence of the Republic, based on extensive close readings of Novalis and Walt Whitman.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Beethovensaal', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Berlin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Neue Rundschau', 'entity': 'Magazine'}, {'span': 'Novalis', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Walt Whitman', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #2: The first writer to use the term classic was Aulus Gellius, a 2nd-century Ancient Rome writer who, in the miscellany Noctes Atticae (19, 8, 15), refers to a writer as a classicus scriptor, non proletarius (A distinguished, not a commonplace writer).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'classic', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Aulus Gellius', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Ancient Rome', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Noctes Atticae', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'classicus scriptor', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'non proletarius', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: John Updike, comparing Abner to a hillbilly Candide, added that the strip's richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the Voltairean.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'John Updike', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Abner', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Candide', 'entity': 'Book'}]'

Example #5: The poems he had written during his time in prison were so effective that Dudley Randall, a poet and owner of Broadside Press, published Knight's first volume of verse, Poems from Prison, and hailed Knight as one of the major poets of the Black Arts Movement.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Dudley Randall', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Broadside Press', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': "Knight's first volume of verse", 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Poems from Prison', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Black Arts Movement', 'entity': 'Event'}]'
