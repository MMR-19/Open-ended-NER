Example #1: In 1927 Lu was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, for the short story The TRUE Story of Ah Q, despite a poor English translation and annotations that were nearly double the size of the text. Kowallis 3 Lu rejected the possibility of accepting the nomination.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lu', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Literature', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'short story', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'The TRUE Story of Ah Q', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'English', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Kowallis 3 Lu', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #2: Nobel Prize -winning writer Isaac Bashevis Singer translated some of his works.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nobel Prize', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Isaac Bashevis Singer', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #3: In 2012, when the Nobel Prize Records were opened after 50 years, it was revealed that Durrell had been on a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with American John Steinbeck (winner), British poet Robert Graves, French writer Jean Anouilh, and the Danish Karen Blixen.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Nobel Prize Records', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Durrell', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Literature', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'American', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'John Steinbeck', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'British', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Robert Graves', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'French', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Jean Anouilh', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Danish', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Karen Blixen', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #4: This acted as a prelude to the release the following year of The Whitsun Weddings, the volume which cemented his reputation; almost immediately after its publication he was granted a Fellowship of the Royal Society of Literature.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The Whitsun Weddings', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Royal Society of Literature', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
