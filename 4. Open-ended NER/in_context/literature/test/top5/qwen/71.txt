Example #1: Dickens has been praised by many of his fellow writers - from Leo Tolstoy to George Orwell, G. K. Chesterton, and Tom Wolfe - for his realism, comedy, prose style, unique characterisations, and social criticism.

Example #2: According to Willmott, Yeats's poems often move from the world of social interaction to a place where the individual finds seclusion, as is also the case in the pastoral Yeats's earlier poems The Lake Isle of Innisfree, The Song of the Happy Shepherd, and The Sad Shepherd.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Willmott', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Yeats', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'The Lake Isle of Innisfree', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'The Song of the Happy Shepherd', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'The Sad Shepherd', 'entity': 'Poem'}]'
