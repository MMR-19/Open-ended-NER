Example #1: This acted as a prelude to the release the following year of The Whitsun Weddings, the volume which cemented his reputation; almost immediately after its publication he was granted a Fellowship of the Royal Society of Literature.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The Whitsun Weddings', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Royal Society of Literature', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Renaissance poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'On My First Sonne', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Celia', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Penshurst', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Salomon Pavy', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'
