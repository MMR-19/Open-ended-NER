Example #1: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: In 1927 Lu was considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, for the short story The TRUE Story of Ah Q, despite a poor English translation and annotations that were nearly double the size of the text. Kowallis 3 Lu rejected the possibility of accepting the nomination.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lu', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Nobel Prize in Literature', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'short story', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'The TRUE Story of Ah Q', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'English', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Kowallis 3 Lu', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'
