Example #1: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Renaissance poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'On My First Sonne', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Celia', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Penshurst', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Salomon Pavy', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #2: Swift is remembered for works such as A Tale of a Tub (1704), An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity (1712), Gulliver's Travels (1726), and A Modest Proposal (1729).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Swift', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'A Tale of a Tub', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': "Gulliver's Travels", 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'A Modest Proposal', 'entity': 'Book'}]'
