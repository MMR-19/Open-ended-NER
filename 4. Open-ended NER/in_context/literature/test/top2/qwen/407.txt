Example #1: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Renaissance poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'On My First Sonne', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Celia', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Penshurst', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Salomon Pavy', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #2: United States poets such as John Ashbery, Marilyn Hacker, Donald Justice (Pantoum of the Great Depression), and David Trinidad have done work in this form, as has Irish poet Caitriona O 'Reilly.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'United States', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'John Ashbery', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Marilyn Hacker', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Donald Justice', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Pantoum of the Great Depression', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'David Trinidad', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Irish', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': "Caitriona O 'Reilly", 'entity': 'Writer'}]'
