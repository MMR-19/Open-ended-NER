Example #1: For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: On My First Sonne; To Celia; To Penshurst; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Renaissance poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'On My First Sonne', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Celia', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'To Penshurst', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Salomon Pavy', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jonson', 'entity': 'Writer'}]'

Example #2: Highly regarded in his lifetime and for a period thereafter, he is now largely remembered for his anti-slavery writings and his poems Barbara Frietchie, The Barefoot Boy, Maud Muller and Snow-Bound.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'anti-slavery writings', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'poems', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Barbara Frietchie', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'The Barefoot Boy', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Maud Muller', 'entity': 'Poem'}, {'span': 'Snow-Bound', 'entity': 'Poem'}]'
