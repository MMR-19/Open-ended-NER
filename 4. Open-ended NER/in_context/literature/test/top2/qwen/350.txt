Example #1: Due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his Foundation series, he did so with Foundation's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1992), his last novel.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Asimov', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Foundation series', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': "Foundation's Edge", 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Foundation and Earth', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'trilogy', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Prelude to Foundation', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Forward the Foundation', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'novel', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}]'

Example #2: Verne's collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864), Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870), and Around the World in Eighty Days (1873).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Verne', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Pierre-Jules Hetzel', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Voyages extraordinaires', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'novels', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}, {'span': 'Journey to the Center of the Earth', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Around the World in Eighty Days', 'entity': 'Book'}]'
