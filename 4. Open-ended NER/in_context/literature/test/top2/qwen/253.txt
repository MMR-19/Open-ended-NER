Example #1: In an article for The Atlantic, film critic Ty Burr deemed The Birth of a Nation the most influential film in history while criticizing its portrayal of black men as savage.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The Atlantic', 'entity': 'Magazine'}, {'span': 'Ty Burr', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'The Birth of a Nation', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
