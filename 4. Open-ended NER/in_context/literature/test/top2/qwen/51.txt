Example #1: Due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his Foundation series, he did so with Foundation's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1992), his last novel.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Asimov', 'entity': 'Writer'}, {'span': 'Foundation series', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': "Foundation's Edge", 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Foundation and Earth', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'trilogy', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Prelude to Foundation', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Forward the Foundation', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'novel', 'entity': 'Literary Genre'}]'

Example #2: Other works soon followed, including A Tale of Two Cities (1859) and Great Expectations (1861), which were resounding successes.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'A Tale of Two Cities', 'entity': 'Book'}, {'span': 'Great Expectations', 'entity': 'Book'}]'
