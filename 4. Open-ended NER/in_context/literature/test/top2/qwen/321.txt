Example #1: The film was presented at the Cannes Film Festival, won the Grand Prix Spécial du Jury and the FIPRESCI prize, and was nominated for the Palme d 'Or.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Cannes Film Festival', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Grand Prix Spécial du Jury', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'FIPRESCI prize', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': "Palme d 'Or", 'entity': 'Award'}]'

Example #2: In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Academy Award for Best Director that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sidney Lumet', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Kurosawa', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Oscar', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Academy Award for Best Director', 'entity': 'Award'}, {'span': 'Sydney Pollack', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Out of Africa', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
