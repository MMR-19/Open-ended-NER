Example #1: By the time of the 1997 Irish general election Sinn Féin stated that they would prefer a Fianna Fáil led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IRA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Fine Gael', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: Fianna Fáil was last in government from 1997 Irish general election to 2011 Irish general election under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, with a periodic high of 81 seats in 2002 Irish general election, reduced to 77 in 2007 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Bertie Ahern', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Brian Cowen', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2002 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2007 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #3: This resulted in significant breakthroughs at the 2013 United Kingdom local elections, 2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom, and 2015 United Kingdom general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2013 United Kingdom local elections', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2015 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #4: In the 1994 European Parliament election in Ireland, Patricia McKenna topped the poll in the Dublin constituency and Nuala Ahern won a seat in Leinster.

Example #5: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #6: The January 1910 United Kingdom general election and December 1910 United Kingdom general election elections in 1910 destroyed the large Liberal majority, meaning they relied on the Irish Parliamentary Party to maintain a government.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'January 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'December 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Liberal', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #7: The party won two additional seats in the 1985 Belgian general election, two additional seats in 1987 Belgian general election and one in 1991 Belgian general election: in that year it won seven seats in parliament.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1985 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1987 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1991 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #8: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #9: The devolved administration was suspended several times (especially between 15 October 2002 and 8 May 2007) because the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party were uncomfortable being in government with Sinn Féin when the Provisional Irish Republican Army had failed to decommission its arms fully and continued its criminal activities.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ulster Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Democratic Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #10: After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton), was elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election, representing the riding of Trinity - Spadina, and the Bloc Québécois had an ethnic Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle - Émard against Liberal Party of Canada leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.
