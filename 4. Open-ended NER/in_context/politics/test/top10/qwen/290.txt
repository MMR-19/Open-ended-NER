Example #1: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and its leadership of so-called Red Tories for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Progressive Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red Tories', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Social Credit Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Reform Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #3: By the time of the 1997 Irish general election Sinn Féin stated that they would prefer a Fianna Fáil led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IRA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Fine Gael', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #4: At the turn of the 19th century, nine out of ten workers were engaged in harbour activities, but as the century progressed ships became too large for the shallow harbour and the port lost business to the deep water ports at Liverpool, Southampton and Plymouth.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Liverpool', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Southampton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Plymouth', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: There are Lord Edward Streets named in his honour in many places in Ireland, such as Dublin, Limerick, Sligo, Kilkenny, Ballina, Ballymote, and Ballycullenbeg in County Laois.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lord Edward Streets', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Ireland', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Dublin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Limerick', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Sligo', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Kilkenny', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Ballina', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Ballymote', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Ballycullenbeg', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'County Laois', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #6: The 2001 Local Government Act restyled the five county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Waterford, and Limerick as city councils, with the same status in law as county councils.

Example #7: The devolved administration was suspended several times (especially between 15 October 2002 and 8 May 2007) because the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party were uncomfortable being in government with Sinn Féin when the Provisional Irish Republican Army had failed to decommission its arms fully and continued its criminal activities.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ulster Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Democratic Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #8: The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matthew Quay and John Wanamaker.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Republicans', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Calvin S. Brice', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William H. Barnum', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Matthew Quay', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'John Wanamaker', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #9: A number of the wealthiest and most affluent American families (Old Money) - such as the Vanderbilts, Astor family, Rockefeller family, Du Pont family, Roosevelt family, Forbes, Whitneys, Junius Spencer Morgan, and Harrimans - are mostly Mainline Protestant families in the Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or other similar traditions.

Example #10: In the 1994 European Parliament election in Ireland, Patricia McKenna topped the poll in the Dublin constituency and Nuala Ahern won a seat in Leinster.
