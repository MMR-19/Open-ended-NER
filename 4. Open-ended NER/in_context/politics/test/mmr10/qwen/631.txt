Example #3: In an interview for Antena 3, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Liviu Dragnea, stated that even though his party agrees with the referendum, there are many voices that say that the referendum is actually useless for the publicly expressed purpose and that it actually is a way for Klaus Iohannis to get involved in the electoral campaign so that he can help parties around him.
