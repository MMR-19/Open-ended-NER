Example #1: From their 18 % share of the first German federal elections under proportional representation in 1919 German federal election, they dropped, for example, to 4.9 % in the 1928 German federal election and to 1.0 % in the November 1932 German federal election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'first German federal elections', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1919 German federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1928 German federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'November 1932 German federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1932 German presidential election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'SPD', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Paul von Hindenburg', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': "National Socialist German Workers ' Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'NSDAP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Adolf Hitler', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
