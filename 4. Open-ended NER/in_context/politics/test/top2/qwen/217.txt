Example #1: This promise was seen as key to his victory in many ridings, such as those in the suburbs around Longueuil and Quebec City and the continued support of the Anglophone community in the West Island of Montreal.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Longueuil', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Quebec City', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Anglophone', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}]'
