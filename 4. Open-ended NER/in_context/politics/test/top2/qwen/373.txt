Example #1: Fianna Fáil was last in government from 1997 Irish general election to 2011 Irish general election under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, with a periodic high of 81 seats in 2002 Irish general election, reduced to 77 in 2007 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Bertie Ahern', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Brian Cowen', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2002 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2007 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
