Example #1: On 12 April 2019 a new Eurosceptic party, the Brexit Party was officially launched by former UK Independence Party Leader Nigel Farage.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Brexit Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'UK Independence Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Nigel Farage', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: In an interview for Antena 3, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Liviu Dragnea, stated that even though his party agrees with the referendum, there are many voices that say that the referendum is actually useless for the publicly expressed purpose and that it actually is a way for Klaus Iohannis to get involved in the electoral campaign so that he can help parties around him.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Antena 3', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Social Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Liviu Dragnea', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Klaus Iohannis', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
