Example #1: It was not registered as an official party, but some participants in that effort went on to form the Green Party of Canada in 1983 (the Green Party of Ontario and Green Party of British Columbia were also formed that year).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Green Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Green Party of Ontario', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Green Party of British Columbia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton), was elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election, representing the riding of Trinity - Spadina, and the Bloc Québécois had an ethnic Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle - Émard against Liberal Party of Canada leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'New Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Olivia Chow', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'NDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Jack Layton', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 Canadian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Trinity - Spadina', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bloc Québécois', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'May Chiu', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'LaSalle - Émard', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Liberal Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Paul Martin', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
