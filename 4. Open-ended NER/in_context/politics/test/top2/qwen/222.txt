Example #1: This promise was seen as key to his victory in many ridings, such as those in the suburbs around Longueuil and Quebec City and the continued support of the Anglophone community in the West Island of Montreal.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Longueuil', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Quebec City', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Anglophone', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: The devolved administration was suspended several times (especially between 15 October 2002 and 8 May 2007) because the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party were uncomfortable being in government with Sinn Féin when the Provisional Irish Republican Army had failed to decommission its arms fully and continued its criminal activities.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ulster Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Democratic Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
