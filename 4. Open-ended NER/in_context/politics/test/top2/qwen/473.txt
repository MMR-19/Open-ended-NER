Example #1: The major political parties at this time were the Polish Socialist Party, National Democracy, various Peasant Parties, Polish Christian Democratic Party, and political groups of ethnic minorities (German: German Social Democratic Party of Poland, Jewish: General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland, United Jewish Socialist Workers Party, and Ukrainian: Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Polish Socialist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Democracy', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Peasant Parties', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Polish Christian Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'German Social Democratic Party of Poland', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Jewish', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'United Jewish Socialist Workers Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Ukrainian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
