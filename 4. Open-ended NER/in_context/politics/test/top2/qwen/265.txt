Example #1: The January 1910 United Kingdom general election and December 1910 United Kingdom general election elections in 1910 destroyed the large Liberal majority, meaning they relied on the Irish Parliamentary Party to maintain a government.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'January 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'December 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Liberal', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and its leadership of so-called Red Tories for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Progressive Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red Tories', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Social Credit Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Reform Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
