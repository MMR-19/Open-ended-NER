Example #1: This did not happen and the presidency, having been damaged by three late nineteenth and early twentieth century assassinations (Abraham Lincoln, Garfield and William McKinley) and one impeachment (Johnson), reasserted its political dominance by the early twentieth century through such figures as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.
