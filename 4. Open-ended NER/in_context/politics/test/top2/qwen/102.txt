Example #1: The party was directly succeeded by the Canadian Alliance in 2000, which merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 2003 to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada.

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Green Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Green Party of Ontario', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Green Party of British Columbia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
