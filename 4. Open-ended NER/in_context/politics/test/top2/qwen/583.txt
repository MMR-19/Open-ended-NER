Example #1: Despite losses for the SPD, the Red-Green coalition government commanded a very slight majority in the Bundestag and was renewed, with Joschka Fischer as foreign minister, Renate Künast as minister for consumer protection, nutrition and agriculture, and Jürgen Trittin as minister for the environment.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SPD', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red-Green coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bundestag', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Joschka Fischer', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Renate Künast', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Trittin', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: Joschka Fischer became Vice-Chancellor of Germany and foreign minister in the new government, which had two other Green ministers (Andrea Fischer, later Renate Künast, and Jürgen Trittin).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Joschka Fischer', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Germany', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Andrea Fischer', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Renate Künast', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Trittin', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
