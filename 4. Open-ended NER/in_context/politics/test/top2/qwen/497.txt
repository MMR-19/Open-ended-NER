Example #1: As a result, former party chairpersons Fritz Kuhn and Claudia Roth (who had been elected to parliament that year) were no longer able to continue in their executive function and were replaced by former party secretary general Reinhard Bütikofer and former Bundestag member Angelika Beer.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fritz Kuhn', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Claudia Roth', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Reinhard Bütikofer', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Angelika Beer', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: Despite losses for the SPD, the Red-Green coalition government commanded a very slight majority in the Bundestag and was renewed, with Joschka Fischer as foreign minister, Renate Künast as minister for consumer protection, nutrition and agriculture, and Jürgen Trittin as minister for the environment.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SPD', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red-Green coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bundestag', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Joschka Fischer', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Renate Künast', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Trittin', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
