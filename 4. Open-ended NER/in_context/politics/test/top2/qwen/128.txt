Example #1: Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and its leadership of so-called Red Tories for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Progressive Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red Tories', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Social Credit Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Reform Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: Westerwelle stepped down as party leader following the 2011 state elections, in which the party was wiped out in 2011 Saxony-Anhalt state election and 2011 Rhineland-Palatinate state election and lost half its seats in 2011 Baden-Württemberg state election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Westerwelle', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2011 Saxony-Anhalt state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Rhineland-Palatinate state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Baden-Württemberg state election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
