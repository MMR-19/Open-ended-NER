Example #1: This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the Liberal Party of Australia / National Party of Australia Coalition and the Australian Labor Party.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Liberal Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Australian Labor Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
