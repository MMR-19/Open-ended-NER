Example #1: In an interview for Antena 3, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Liviu Dragnea, stated that even though his party agrees with the referendum, there are many voices that say that the referendum is actually useless for the publicly expressed purpose and that it actually is a way for Klaus Iohannis to get involved in the electoral campaign so that he can help parties around him.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Antena 3', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Social Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Liviu Dragnea', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Klaus Iohannis', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allies of World War II, Big Three - Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill - issued the Tehran Declaration to guarantee the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1943 Tehran Conference', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Allies', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'World War II', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Joseph Stalin', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Franklin D.
