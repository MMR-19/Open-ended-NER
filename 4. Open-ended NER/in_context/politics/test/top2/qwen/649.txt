Example #1: In addition to the Tydings-Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the 1950 United States Senate elections, including Everett Dirksen against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tydings-Butler race', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'McCarthy', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Republicans', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': '1950 United States Senate elections', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Everett Dirksen', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Scott W. Lucas', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matthew Quay and John Wanamaker.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Republicans', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Calvin S. Brice', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William H. Barnum', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Matthew Quay', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'John Wanamaker', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
