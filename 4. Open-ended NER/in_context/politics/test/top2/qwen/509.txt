Example #1: In the nineteenth century, the members of the failed Decembrist revolt, Polish nobles who resisted Russian rule, and members of various socialist revolutionary groups, including Bolsheviks such as Sergo Ordzhonikidze, Leon Trotsky, and Joseph Stalin were all sent into exile.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Decembrist revolt', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Polish', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Russian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Bolsheviks', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Sergo Ordzhonikidze', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Leon Trotsky', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Joseph Stalin', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fritz Kuhn', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Claudia Roth', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Reinhard Bütikofer', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Angelika Beer', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
