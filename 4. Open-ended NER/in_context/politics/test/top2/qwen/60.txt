Example #1: The only interruptions occurred in 1813-1814, occasioned by the German War of Liberation (War of the Sixth Coalition), during which the university was closed, and those occasioned by two prolonged literary tours, first in 1820 to Paris, London and Oxford with his colleague Johann Karl Thilo (1794-1853) for the examination of rare oriental manuscripts, and in 1835 to England and the Netherlands in connection with his Phoenician studies.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'War of Liberation', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'War of the Sixth Coalition', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'London', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Oxford', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Johann Karl Thilo', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'England', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Phoenician', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: This did not happen and the presidency, having been damaged by three late nineteenth and early twentieth century assassinations (Abraham Lincoln, Garfield and William McKinley) and one impeachment (Johnson), reasserted its political dominance by the early twentieth century through such figures as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Abraham Lincoln', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Garfield', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William McKinley', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Johnson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Theodore Roosevelt', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Woodrow Wilson', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
