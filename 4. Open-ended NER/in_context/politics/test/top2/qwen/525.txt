Example #1: Though Roosevelt won the backing of Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo and Governor Martin H. Glynn, he faced a formidable opponent in the Tammany-backed James W. Gerard.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Roosevelt', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William Gibbs McAdoo', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Martin H. Glynn', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'James W. Gerard', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matthew Quay and John Wanamaker.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Republicans', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Calvin S. Brice', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William H. Barnum', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Matthew Quay', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'John Wanamaker', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
