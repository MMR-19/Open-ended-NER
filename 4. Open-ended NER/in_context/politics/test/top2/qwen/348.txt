Example #1: As of February 2012 the political composition of the council was: 11 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 6 Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, 3 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 2 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and 1 Green Party in Northern Ireland councillor.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Democratic Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'DUP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Alliance Party of Northern Ireland', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Ulster Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'UUP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Social Democratic and Labour Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'SDLP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Green Party in Northern Ireland', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: The devolved administration was suspended several times (especially between 15 October 2002 and 8 May 2007) because the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party were uncomfortable being in government with Sinn Féin when the Provisional Irish Republican Army had failed to decommission its arms fully and continued its criminal activities.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ulster Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Democratic Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
