Example #1: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: In the subsequent election, Hugo Chávez's political party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela drew 48 % of the votes overall, while the opposition parties (the Democratic Unity Roundtable and the Fatherland for All parties) drew 52 % of the votes.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hugo Chávez', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'United Socialist Party of Venezuela', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Democratic Unity Roundtable', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Fatherland for All', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
