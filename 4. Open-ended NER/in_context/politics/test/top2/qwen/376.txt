Example #1: After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton), was elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election, representing the riding of Trinity - Spadina, and the Bloc Québécois had an ethnic Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle - Émard against Liberal Party of Canada leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'New Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Olivia Chow', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'NDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Jack Layton', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 Canadian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Trinity - Spadina', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bloc Québécois', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'May Chiu', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'LaSalle - Émard', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Liberal Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Paul Martin', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and its leadership of so-called Red Tories for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Progressive Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red Tories', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Social Credit Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Reform Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
