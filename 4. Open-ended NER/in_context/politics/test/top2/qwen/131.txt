Example #1: After unsuccessfully contesting the constituency of Harwich at the 1954 by-election and 1955 United Kingdom general election, as well as the constituency of Southampton Test at the 1959 United Kingdom general election, Williams was returned in the 1964 United Kingdom general election as Labour MP for the constituency of Hitchin in Hertfordshire.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Harwich', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': '1954 by-election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1955 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Southampton Test', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': '1959 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Williams', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1964 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Labour', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Hitchin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Hertfordshire', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton), was elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election, representing the riding of Trinity - Spadina, and the Bloc Québécois had an ethnic Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle - Émard against Liberal Party of Canada leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'New Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Olivia Chow', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'NDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Jack Layton', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 Canadian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Trinity - Spadina', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bloc Québécois', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'May Chiu', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'LaSalle - Émard', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Liberal Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Paul Martin', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
