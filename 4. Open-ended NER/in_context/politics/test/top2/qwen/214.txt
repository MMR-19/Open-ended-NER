Example #1: It is also the home of Universities at Medway, a tri-partite collaboration of the University of Greenwich, the University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University on a single campus in Chatham, together with the University for the Creative Arts, which has a campus in Rochester.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Universities at Medway', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'University of Greenwich', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'University of Kent', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Canterbury Christ Church University', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'University for the Creative Arts', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Rochester', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: The only interruptions occurred in 1813-1814, occasioned by the German War of Liberation (War of the Sixth Coalition), during which the university was closed, and those occasioned by two prolonged literary tours, first in 1820 to Paris, London and Oxford with his colleague Johann Karl Thilo (1794-1853) for the examination of rare oriental manuscripts, and in 1835 to England and the Netherlands in connection with his Phoenician studies.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'War of Liberation', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'War of the Sixth Coalition', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'London', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Oxford', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Johann Karl Thilo', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'England', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Phoenician', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
