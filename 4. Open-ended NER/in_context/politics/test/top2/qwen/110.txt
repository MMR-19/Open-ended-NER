Example #1: The party was directly succeeded by the Canadian Alliance in 2000, which merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 2003 to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Canadian Alliance', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Progressive Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Progressive Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red Tories', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Social Credit Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Reform Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
