Example #1: After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton), was elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election, representing the riding of Trinity - Spadina, and the Bloc Québécois had an ethnic Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle - Émard against Liberal Party of Canada leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'New Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Olivia Chow', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'NDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Jack Layton', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 Canadian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Trinity - Spadina', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bloc Québécois', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'May Chiu', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'LaSalle - Émard', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Liberal Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Paul Martin', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: The first campaign in Illinois was not by Coolidge or Davis, but by radical third-party nominee, veteran Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette, who on July 4 confirmed his previous plan to run a third-party campaign when nominated by the Conference for Progressive Political Action.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Illinois', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Coolidge', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Davis', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Wisconsin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Robert M.
