Example #1: During the 1990s and 2000s, NARAL Pro-Choice America and Planned Parenthood typically gave Kennedy ratings of 100 percent, while the National Right to Life Committee typically gave him a rating of less than 10 percent.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NARAL Pro-Choice America', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Planned Parenthood', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Kennedy', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'National Right to Life Committee', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Wyden', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'NARAL Pro-Choice America', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Planned Parenthood', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'National Right to Life Committee', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
