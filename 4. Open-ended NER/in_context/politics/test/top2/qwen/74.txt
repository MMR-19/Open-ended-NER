Example #1: This did not happen and the presidency, having been damaged by three late nineteenth and early twentieth century assassinations (Abraham Lincoln, Garfield and William McKinley) and one impeachment (Johnson), reasserted its political dominance by the early twentieth century through such figures as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Abraham Lincoln', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Garfield', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William McKinley', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Johnson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Theodore Roosevelt', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Woodrow Wilson', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: Kissinger - along with William Perry, Sam Nunn, and George Shultz - has called upon governments to embrace the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons, and in three Wall Street Journal op-ed s proposed an ambitious program of urgent steps to that end.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Kissinger', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William Perry', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Sam Nunn', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'George Shultz', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Wall Street Journal', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
