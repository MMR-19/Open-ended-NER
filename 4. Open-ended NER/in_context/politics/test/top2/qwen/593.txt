Example #1: The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matthew Quay and John Wanamaker.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Republicans', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Calvin S. Brice', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William H. Barnum', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Matthew Quay', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'John Wanamaker', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: In an interview for Antena 3, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Liviu Dragnea, stated that even though his party agrees with the referendum, there are many voices that say that the referendum is actually useless for the publicly expressed purpose and that it actually is a way for Klaus Iohannis to get involved in the electoral campaign so that he can help parties around him.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Antena 3', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Social Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Liviu Dragnea', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Klaus Iohannis', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
