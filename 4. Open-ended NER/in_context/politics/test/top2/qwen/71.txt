Example #1: This did not happen and the presidency, having been damaged by three late nineteenth and early twentieth century assassinations (Abraham Lincoln, Garfield and William McKinley) and one impeachment (Johnson), reasserted its political dominance by the early twentieth century through such figures as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Abraham Lincoln', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Garfield', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William McKinley', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Johnson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Theodore Roosevelt', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Woodrow Wilson', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: Three United States presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Donald Trump in 2019.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'United States', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'House of Representatives', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Andrew Johnson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Bill Clinton', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Donald Trump', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
