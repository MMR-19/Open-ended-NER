Example #1: Excluding the Japanese Communist Party, the coalition was backed by all of the former opposition parties, which included the newly formed JNP, the Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito), Komeito, the Democratic Socialist Party, the Socialist Democratic Federation, and the New Party Sakigake, who together controlled 243 seats in the House of Representatives.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Japanese Communist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'JNP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Japan Socialist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Japan Renewal Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Shinseito', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Komeito', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Democratic Socialist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Socialist Democratic Federation', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'New Party Sakigake', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #3: This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the Liberal Party of Australia / National Party of Australia Coalition and the Australian Labor Party.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Liberal Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Australian Labor Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Berlusconi', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'House of Freedoms', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Forza Italia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Alliance', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Lega Nord', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Christian Democratic Center', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'United Christian Democrats', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
