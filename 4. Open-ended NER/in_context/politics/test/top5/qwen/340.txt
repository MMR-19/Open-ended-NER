Example #1: After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton), was elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election, representing the riding of Trinity - Spadina, and the Bloc Québécois had an ethnic Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle - Émard against Liberal Party of Canada leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'New Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Olivia Chow', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'NDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Jack Layton', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 Canadian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Trinity - Spadina', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bloc Québécois', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'May Chiu', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'LaSalle - Émard', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Liberal Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Paul Martin', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: The party was directly succeeded by the Canadian Alliance in 2000, which merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 2003 to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Canadian Alliance', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Progressive Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #3: Social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and its leadership of so-called Red Tories for the last half of the twentieth century and therefore many eventually made their political home with parties such as the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Reform Party of Canada.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Progressive Conservative Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red Tories', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Social Credit Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Reform Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #4: In 2004, Thompson wrote: Richard Nixon was a professional politician, and I despised everything he stood for - but if he were running for president this year against the evil George W. Bush - Dick Cheney gang, I would happily vote for him.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Thompson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Richard Nixon', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'George W. Bush', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Dick Cheney', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #5: This promise was seen as key to his victory in many ridings, such as those in the suburbs around Longueuil and Quebec City and the continued support of the Anglophone community in the West Island of Montreal.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Longueuil', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Quebec City', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Anglophone', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}]'
