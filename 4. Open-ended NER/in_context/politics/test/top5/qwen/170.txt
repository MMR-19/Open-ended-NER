Example #1: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton), was elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election, representing the riding of Trinity - Spadina, and the Bloc Québécois had an ethnic Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle - Émard against Liberal Party of Canada leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'New Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Olivia Chow', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'NDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Jack Layton', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 Canadian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Trinity - Spadina', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bloc Québécois', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'May Chiu', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'LaSalle - Émard', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Liberal Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Paul Martin', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2006 election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #3: In the latest elections, which took place in 2011, Retired General Otto Pérez Molina of the Patriotic Party won the presidential election in a runoff against populist Manuel Baldizón of the LIDER party.

Example #4: As a result, former party chairpersons Fritz Kuhn and Claudia Roth (who had been elected to parliament that year) were no longer able to continue in their executive function and were replaced by former party secretary general Reinhard Bütikofer and former Bundestag member Angelika Beer.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fritz Kuhn', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Claudia Roth', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Reinhard Bütikofer', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Angelika Beer', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Union of Democrats for Europe', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Clemente Mastella', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Italy of Values', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Antonio Di Pietro', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Federation of the Greens', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
