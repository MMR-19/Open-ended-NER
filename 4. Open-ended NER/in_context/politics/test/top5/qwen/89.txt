Example #1: This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the Liberal Party of Australia / National Party of Australia Coalition and the Australian Labor Party.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Liberal Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Australian Labor Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #3: The party won two additional seats in the 1985 Belgian general election, two additional seats in 1987 Belgian general election and one in 1991 Belgian general election: in that year it won seven seats in parliament.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1985 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1987 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1991 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #4: Following their victory, the Khmer Rouge who were led by Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, Ieng Sary, Son Sen, and Khieu Samphan immediately set about forcibly evacuating the country's major cities and in 1976 they renamed the country Democratic Kampuchea.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Khmer Rouge', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Pol Pot', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Nuon Chea', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Ieng Sary', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Son Sen', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Khieu Samphan', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Democratic Kampuchea', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #5: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
