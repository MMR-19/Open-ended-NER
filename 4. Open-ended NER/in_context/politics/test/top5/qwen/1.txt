Example #1: The prestige of the Speakership caused them to abandon life in a Washington boarding house for their own residence on Pennsylvania. In the 1836 United States presidential election, Vice President Martin Van Buren, Jackson's chosen successor, defeated multiple Whig candidates, including Tennessee Senator Hugh Lawson White.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Washington boarding house', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Pennsylvania', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': '1836 United States presidential election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Martin Van Buren', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Jackson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Whig', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Tennessee', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Hugh Lawson White', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: Three United States presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Donald Trump in 2019.

Example #3: This did not happen and the presidency, having been damaged by three late nineteenth and early twentieth century assassinations (Abraham Lincoln, Garfield and William McKinley) and one impeachment (Johnson), reasserted its political dominance by the early twentieth century through such figures as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Abraham Lincoln', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Garfield', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William McKinley', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Johnson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Theodore Roosevelt', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Woodrow Wilson', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #4: As a result, former party chairpersons Fritz Kuhn and Claudia Roth (who had been elected to parliament that year) were no longer able to continue in their executive function and were replaced by former party secretary general Reinhard Bütikofer and former Bundestag member Angelika Beer.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fritz Kuhn', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Claudia Roth', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Reinhard Bütikofer', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Angelika Beer', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Madison', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Federalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Rufus King', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1816 United States presidential election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
