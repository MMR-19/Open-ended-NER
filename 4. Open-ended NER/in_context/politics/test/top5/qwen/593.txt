Example #1: The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matthew Quay and John Wanamaker.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Republicans', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Calvin S. Brice', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William H. Barnum', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Matthew Quay', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'John Wanamaker', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: In an interview for Antena 3, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, Liviu Dragnea, stated that even though his party agrees with the referendum, there are many voices that say that the referendum is actually useless for the publicly expressed purpose and that it actually is a way for Klaus Iohannis to get involved in the electoral campaign so that he can help parties around him.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Antena 3', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Social Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Liviu Dragnea', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Klaus Iohannis', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #3: This promise was seen as key to his victory in many ridings, such as those in the suburbs around Longueuil and Quebec City and the continued support of the Anglophone community in the West Island of Montreal.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Longueuil', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Quebec City', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Anglophone', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #4: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #5: Manuel Zelaya of the Liberal Party of Honduras (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) won, with Porfirio Pepe Lobo of the National Party of Honduras (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) coming in second.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Manuel Zelaya', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Liberal Party of Honduras', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Partido Liberal de Honduras', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'PLH', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Porfirio Pepe Lobo', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'National Party of Honduras', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Partido Nacional de Honduras', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'PNH', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
