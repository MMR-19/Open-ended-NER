Example #1: The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, adroitly used the defection of a Soviet official to his advantage, and his coalition of the Liberal and National Party of Australia parties was returned in the 1954 Australian federal election with a seven-seat majority.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Robert Menzies', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Soviet', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Liberal', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1954 Australian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: Various Governors-General had previously served as governors of an Australian state or colony: Lord Hopetoun (Victoria 1889-1895); Lord Tennyson (South Australia 1899-1902); Lord Gowrie (South Australia 1928-34; and New South Wales 1935-1936); Major General Michael Jeffery (Western Australia 1993-2000); Quentin Bryce (Queensland 2003-2008); General David Hurley (New South Wales 2014 - 2019).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Australian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Lord Hopetoun', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Victoria', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Lord Tennyson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'South Australia', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Lord Gowrie', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'New South Wales', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Michael Jeffery', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Western Australia', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Quentin Bryce', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Queensland', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'David Hurley', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #3: This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the Liberal Party of Australia / National Party of Australia Coalition and the Australian Labor Party.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Liberal Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Australian Labor Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #4: Despite losses for the SPD, the Red-Green coalition government commanded a very slight majority in the Bundestag and was renewed, with Joschka Fischer as foreign minister, Renate Künast as minister for consumer protection, nutrition and agriculture, and Jürgen Trittin as minister for the environment.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SPD', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Red-Green coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bundestag', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Joschka Fischer', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Renate Künast', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Trittin', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #5: Most of the party's major figures, including Evatt, Deputy Leader Arthur Calwell, Eddie Ward, and Reg Pollard, were in their sixties, twenty years older than Whitlam.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Evatt', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Arthur Calwell', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Eddie Ward', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Reg Pollard', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Whitlam', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
