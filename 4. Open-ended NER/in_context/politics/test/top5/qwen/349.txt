Example #1: By the time of the 1997 Irish general election Sinn Féin stated that they would prefer a Fianna Fáil led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IRA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Fine Gael', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #2: Fianna Fáil was last in government from 1997 Irish general election to 2011 Irish general election under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, with a periodic high of 81 seats in 2002 Irish general election, reduced to 77 in 2007 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Bertie Ahern', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Brian Cowen', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2002 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2007 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #3: In the 1994 European Parliament election in Ireland, Patricia McKenna topped the poll in the Dublin constituency and Nuala Ahern won a seat in Leinster.

Example #4: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #5: As of February 2012 the political composition of the council was: 11 Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), 6 Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, 3 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), 2 Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and 1 Green Party in Northern Ireland councillor.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Democratic Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'DUP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Alliance Party of Northern Ireland', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Ulster Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'UUP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Social Democratic and Labour Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'SDLP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Green Party in Northern Ireland', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
