Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Westerwelle', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2011 Saxony-Anhalt state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Rhineland-Palatinate state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Baden-Württemberg state election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '2011 Bremen state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Berlin state election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
