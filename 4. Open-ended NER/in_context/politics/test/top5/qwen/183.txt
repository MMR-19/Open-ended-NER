Example #1: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: By the time of the 1997 Irish general election Sinn Féin stated that they would prefer a Fianna Fáil led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IRA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Fine Gael', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #3: Fianna Fáil was last in government from 1997 Irish general election to 2011 Irish general election under Bertie Ahern and Brian Cowen, with a periodic high of 81 seats in 2002 Irish general election, reduced to 77 in 2007 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Bertie Ahern', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Brian Cowen', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '2002 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2007 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #4: In the 1994 European Parliament election in Ireland, Patricia McKenna topped the poll in the Dublin constituency and Nuala Ahern won a seat in Leinster.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1994 European Parliament election in Ireland', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Patricia McKenna', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Dublin', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Nuala Ahern', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Leinster', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #5: He was also the Member of Parliament for Upper Bann from 1990 Upper Bann by-election to 2005 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland and the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Upper Bann from 1998 to 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Parliament', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Upper Bann', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': '1990 Upper Bann by-election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2005 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Legislative Assembly', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'MLA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': '2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
