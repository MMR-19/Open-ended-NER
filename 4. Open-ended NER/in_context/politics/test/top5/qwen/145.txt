Example #1: This resulted in significant breakthroughs at the 2013 United Kingdom local elections, 2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom, and 2015 United Kingdom general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2013 United Kingdom local elections', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2014 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2015 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: The party won two additional seats in the 1985 Belgian general election, two additional seats in 1987 Belgian general election and one in 1991 Belgian general election: in that year it won seven seats in parliament.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1985 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1987 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1991 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #3: In the subsequent election, Hugo Chávez's political party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela drew 48 % of the votes overall, while the opposition parties (the Democratic Unity Roundtable and the Fatherland for All parties) drew 52 % of the votes.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hugo Chávez', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'United Socialist Party of Venezuela', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Democratic Unity Roundtable', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Fatherland for All', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #4: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #5: The January 1910 United Kingdom general election and December 1910 United Kingdom general election elections in 1910 destroyed the large Liberal majority, meaning they relied on the Irish Parliamentary Party to maintain a government.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'January 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'December 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Liberal', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
