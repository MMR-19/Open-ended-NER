Example #1: Assisted by his top aide Harry Hopkins and with very strong national support, he worked closely with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek in leading the Allied Powers against the Axis Powers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Harry Hopkins', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'British', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Winston Churchill', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Soviet', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Joseph Stalin', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Chinese', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Chiang Kai-shek', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Allied Powers', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Axis Powers', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: As agreed with the Allies of World War II at the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union entered World War II's Pacific Theater within three months of the end of the war in Europe.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Allies of World War II', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Tehran Conference', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Yalta Conference', 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Soviet Union', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': "World War II's Pacific Theater", 'entity': 'Event'}, {'span': 'Europe', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #4: The devolved administration was suspended several times (especially between 15 October 2002 and 8 May 2007) because the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party were uncomfortable being in government with Sinn Féin when the Provisional Irish Republican Army had failed to decommission its arms fully and continued its criminal activities.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Ulster Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Democratic Unionist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Provisional Irish Republican Army', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
