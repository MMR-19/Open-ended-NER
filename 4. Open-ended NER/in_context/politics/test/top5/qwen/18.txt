Example #1: Various Governors-General had previously served as governors of an Australian state or colony: Lord Hopetoun (Victoria 1889-1895); Lord Tennyson (South Australia 1899-1902); Lord Gowrie (South Australia 1928-34; and New South Wales 1935-1936); Major General Michael Jeffery (Western Australia 1993-2000); Quentin Bryce (Queensland 2003-2008); General David Hurley (New South Wales 2014 - 2019).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Australian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Lord Hopetoun', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Victoria', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Lord Tennyson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'South Australia', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Lord Gowrie', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'New South Wales', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Michael Jeffery', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Western Australia', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Quentin Bryce', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Queensland', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'David Hurley', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #2: This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major parties, the Liberal Party of Australia / National Party of Australia Coalition and the Australian Labor Party.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Liberal Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Australian Labor Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #3: The Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, adroitly used the defection of a Soviet official to his advantage, and his coalition of the Liberal and National Party of Australia parties was returned in the 1954 Australian federal election with a seven-seat majority.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Robert Menzies', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Soviet', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Liberal', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1954 Australian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'January 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'December 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Liberal', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #5: After narrowly losing the 1969 Australian federal election, Whitlam led Labor to victory at the 1972 election after 23 years of continuous Liberal Party of Australia - National Party of Australia Coalition Government.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1969 Australian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Whitlam', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Labor', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Liberal Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Party of Australia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
