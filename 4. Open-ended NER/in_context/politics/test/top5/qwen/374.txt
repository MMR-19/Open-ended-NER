Example #1: The party won two additional seats in the 1985 Belgian general election, two additional seats in 1987 Belgian general election and one in 1991 Belgian general election: in that year it won seven seats in parliament.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1985 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1987 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1991 Belgian general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #2: Subsequently, the party allied itself with the New Liberal Movement in the formation of the Australian Democrats for the 1977 Australian federal election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'New Liberal Movement', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Australian Democrats', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1977 Australian federal election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #3: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #4: The following three parliamentary elections (in 1930 Polish legislative election, 1935 Polish legislative election and 1938 Polish legislative election) were manipulated, with opposition activists sent to Bereza Kartuska prison (see also Brest trials).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1930 Polish legislative election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1935 Polish legislative election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '1938 Polish legislative election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Bereza Kartuska prison', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Brest trials', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: The change in leadership failed to revive the FDP's fortunes, however, and in the next series of state elections, the party lost all its seats in 2011 Bremen state election, 2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election, and 2011 Berlin state election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '2011 Bremen state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Berlin state election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'
