Example #2: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Bruton', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IPP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '1918 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Polish Socialist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'National Democracy', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Peasant Parties', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Polish Christian Democratic Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'German Social Democratic Party of Poland', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Jewish', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'United Jewish Socialist Workers Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Ukrainian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #4: By the time of the 1997 Irish general election Sinn Féin stated that they would prefer a Fianna Fáil led government and the IRA resumed their ceasefire soon after Fine Gael lost the 1997 Irish general election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '1997 Irish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Sinn Féin', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Fianna Fáil', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'IRA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Fine Gael', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'
