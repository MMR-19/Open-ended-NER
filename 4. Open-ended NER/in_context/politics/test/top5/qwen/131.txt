Example #1: After unsuccessfully contesting the constituency of Harwich at the 1954 by-election and 1955 United Kingdom general election, as well as the constituency of Southampton Test at the 1959 United Kingdom general election, Williams was returned in the 1964 United Kingdom general election as Labour MP for the constituency of Hitchin in Hertfordshire.
