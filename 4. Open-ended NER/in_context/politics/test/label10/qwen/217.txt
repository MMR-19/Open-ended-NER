Example #1: After two failed attempts, New Democratic Party candidate Olivia Chow (wife of NDP leader Jack Layton), was elected in the 2006 Canadian federal election, representing the riding of Trinity - Spadina, and the Bloc Québécois had an ethnic Chinese candidate, May Chiu, running in the riding of LaSalle - Émard against Liberal Party of Canada leader Paul Martin during the 2006 election.

Example #2: It was not registered as an official party, but some participants in that effort went on to form the Green Party of Canada in 1983 (the Green Party of Ontario and Green Party of British Columbia were also formed that year).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Green Party of Canada', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Green Party of Ontario', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Green Party of British Columbia', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #3: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "The People's Party", 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Aznar', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1996 Spanish general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Congress of Deputies', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Basque', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Basque Nationalist Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Catalan', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Convergence and Union', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Canarian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Canarian Coalition', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #4: The change in leadership failed to revive the FDP's fortunes, however, and in the next series of state elections, the party lost all its seats in 2011 Bremen state election, 2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election, and 2011 Berlin state election.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FDP', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': '2011 Bremen state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': '2011 Berlin state election', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #5: Motivated by Tower's victory, and hoping to prevent the far-right John Birch Society from coming to power, Bush ran for the chairmanship of the Harris County, Texas Republican Party, winning election in February 1963. Like most other Texas Republicans, Bush supported conservative Senator Barry Goldwater over the more centrist Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 Republican Party presidential primaries.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Tower', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'John Birch Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Bush', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Harris County', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Texas', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Republican Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Texas Republicans', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Barry Goldwater', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Nelson Rockefeller', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': '1964 Republican Party presidential primaries', 'entity': 'Election'}]'

Example #6: The Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matthew Quay and John Wanamaker.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Republicans', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Calvin S. Brice', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'William H. Barnum', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Matthew Quay', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'John Wanamaker', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'

Example #7: In June 1970, a Dutch group called Kabouters won 5 of the 45 seats on the Amsterdam Gemeenteraad (City Council), as well as two seats each on councils in The Hague and Leeuwarden and one seat apiece in Arnhem, Alkmaar and Leiden.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Dutch', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Kabouters', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Amsterdam', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'The Hague', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Leeuwarden', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Arnhem', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Alkmaar', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Leiden', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #8: The January 1910 United Kingdom general election and December 1910 United Kingdom general election elections in 1910 destroyed the large Liberal majority, meaning they relied on the Irish Parliamentary Party to maintain a government.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'January 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'December 1910 United Kingdom general election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Liberal', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Irish Parliamentary Party', 'entity': 'Political Party'}]'

Example #9: Though most other Texas Republicans supported Ronald Reagan in the 1968 Republican Party presidential primaries, Bush endorsed Richard Nixon, who went on to win the party's nomination.

Example #10: The prestige of the Speakership caused them to abandon life in a Washington boarding house for their own residence on Pennsylvania. In the 1836 United States presidential election, Vice President Martin Van Buren, Jackson's chosen successor, defeated multiple Whig candidates, including Tennessee Senator Hugh Lawson White.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Washington boarding house', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Pennsylvania', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': '1836 United States presidential election', 'entity': 'Election'}, {'span': 'Martin Van Buren', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Jackson', 'entity': 'Politician'}, {'span': 'Whig', 'entity': 'Political Party'}, {'span': 'Tennessee', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Hugh Lawson White', 'entity': 'Politician'}]'
