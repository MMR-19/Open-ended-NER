Example #1: Whereas most leaders had come from or identified with the independence movement Sinn Féin (in its 1917-22 phase), Bruton identified more with the more moderate Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) tradition that Sinn Féin had eclipsed at the 1918 Irish general election.

Example #3: The People's Party, led by Aznar, won the most parliamentary seats at the 1996 Spanish general election, but he failed to obtain a majority in the Congress of Deputies, which forced the PP to seek the support of Basque (Basque Nationalist Party), Catalan (Convergence and Union) and Canarian (Canarian Coalition) regionalists.
