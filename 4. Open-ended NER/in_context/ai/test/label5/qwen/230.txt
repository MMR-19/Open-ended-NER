Example #1: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #2: The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) -based systems introduced by Alex Graves of Google DeepMind and Navdeep Jaitly of the University of Toronto in 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'end-to-end ASR', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Connectionist Temporal Classification', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'CTC', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Alex Graves', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Google DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Navdeep Jaitly', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'University of Toronto', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #3: The National Science Foundation was an umbrella for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Energy, the US Department of Commerce NIST, the US Department of Defense, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Office of Naval Research coordinated studies to inform strategic planners in their deliberations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'National Science Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'NASA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Energy', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Commerce NIST', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Defense', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'DARPA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Office of Naval Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificially intelligent robots', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Ex Machina', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Westworld', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
