Example #1: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Neuroevolution', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #2: Beginning at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, films may now be restricted from screening at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto - one of the festival's main venues - and screened elsewhere (such as TIFF Bell Lightbox and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2019 Toronto International Film Festival', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Scotiabank Theatre Toronto', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'TIFF Bell Lightbox', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Netflix', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #3: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'computational linguistics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'David Hays', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'International Committee on Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ICCL', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #5: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
