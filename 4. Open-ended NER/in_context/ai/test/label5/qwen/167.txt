Example #1: One of the metrics used in NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences", 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'summarization', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'translation tasks', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'ROUGE metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Neural Information Processing Systems', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'NIPS', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Canada', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #2: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: The sigmoid function s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package sigmoid, with the intention to enable more general use.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sigmoid function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'sigmoid', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #5: The National Science Foundation was an umbrella for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Energy, the US Department of Commerce NIST, the US Department of Defense, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Office of Naval Research coordinated studies to inform strategic planners in their deliberations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'National Science Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'NASA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Energy', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Commerce NIST', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Defense', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'DARPA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Office of Naval Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
