Example #1: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'precision', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'recall', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: With the advent of component-based frameworks such as .NET and Java, component based development environments are capable of deploying the developed neural network to these frameworks as inheritable components.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '.NET', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #5: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'
