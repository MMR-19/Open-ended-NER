Example #1: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Neuroevolution', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #2: Between 2009 and 2012, the recurrent neural network s and deep feedforward neural network s developed in the research group of Jürgen Schmidhuber at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA have won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recurrent neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'deep feedforward neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Swiss AI Lab IDSIA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #3: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.

Example #5: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
