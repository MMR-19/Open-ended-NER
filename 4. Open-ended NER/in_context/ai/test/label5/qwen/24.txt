Example #1: Also in regression analysis, mean squared error, often referred to as mean squared prediction error or out-of-sample mean squared error, can refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the TRUE values, over an out-of-sample test space, generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space.

Example #2: 59, pp. 2547-2553, Oct. 2011 In one dimensional polynomial-based memory (or memoryless) DPD, in order to solve for the digital pre-distorter polynomials coefficients and minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the distorted output of the nonlinear system must be over-sampled at a rate that enables the capture of the nonlinear products of the order of the digital pre-distorter.

Example #3: If we use least squares to fit a function in the form of a hyperplane ŷ = a + β supT / sup x to the data (x sub i / sub, y sub i / sub) sub 1 ≤ i ≤ n / sub, we could then assess the fit using the mean squared error (MSE).

Example #4: If the signal is further ergodic, all sample paths exhibits the same time-average and thus mathR _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) = \ widehat { R } _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) / math in mean square error sense.

Example #5: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.
