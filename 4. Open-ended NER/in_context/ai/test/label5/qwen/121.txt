Example #1: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #2: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #3: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: An optimal value for math \ alpha / math can be found by using a line search algorithm, that is, the magnitude of math \ alpha / math is determined by finding the value that minimizes S, usually using a line search in the interval math0 \ alpha 1 / math or a backtracking line search such as Armijo-line search.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'line search algorithm', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backtracking line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Armijo-line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #5: Voice user interfaces that interpret and manage conversational state are challenging to design due to the inherent difficulty of integrating complex natural language processing tasks like coreference resolution, named-entity recognition, information retrieval, and dialog management.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voice user interfaces', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'coreference resolution', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'named-entity recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'dialog management', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
