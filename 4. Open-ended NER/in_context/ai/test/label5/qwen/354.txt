Example #1: The technique used in creating eigenfaces and using them for recognition is also used outside of face recognition: handwriting recognition, lip reading, voice recognition, sign language / hand gestures interpretation and medical imaging analysis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eigenfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'face recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'handwriting recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'lip reading', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'voice recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'sign language', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'hand gestures interpretation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'medical imaging analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #2: J48 is an open source Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm in the Weka data mining tool.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'J48', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'C4.5 algorithm', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Weka data mining tool', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn Feature learning in an unsupervised learning manner.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'autoencoder', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'artificial neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Feature learning', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'unsupervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #5: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
