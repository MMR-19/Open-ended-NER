Example #1: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Neuroevolution', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #3: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: The sigmoid function s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package sigmoid, with the intention to enable more general use.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sigmoid function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'sigmoid', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #5: An optimal value for math \ alpha / math can be found by using a line search algorithm, that is, the magnitude of math \ alpha / math is determined by finding the value that minimizes S, usually using a line search in the interval math0 \ alpha 1 / math or a backtracking line search such as Armijo-line search.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'line search algorithm', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backtracking line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Armijo-line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
