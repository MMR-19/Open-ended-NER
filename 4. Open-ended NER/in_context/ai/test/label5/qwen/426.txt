Example #1: The inclusion of a C + + interpreter (CINT until version 5.34, Cling from version 6) makes this package very versatile as it can be used in interactive, scripted and compiled modes in a manner similar to commercial products like MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'C + +', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'CINT', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Cling', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: With the advent of component-based frameworks such as .NET and Java, component based development environments are capable of deploying the developed neural network to these frameworks as inheritable components.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '.NET', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #3: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: Between 2009 and 2012, the recurrent neural network s and deep feedforward neural network s developed in the research group of Jürgen Schmidhuber at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA have won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recurrent neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'deep feedforward neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Swiss AI Lab IDSIA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #5: The sigmoid function s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package sigmoid, with the intention to enable more general use.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sigmoid function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'sigmoid', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
