Example #1: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: Unimation purchased Victor Scheinman ' s Vicarm Inc. in 1977, and with Scheinman's help, the company created and began producing the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly, a new model of robotic arm, and using Scheinman's cutting-edge VAL programming language.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Unimation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Victor Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Vicarm Inc.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'VAL programming language', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'

Example #3: The sigmoid function s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package sigmoid, with the intention to enable more general use.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sigmoid function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'sigmoid', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #4: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #5: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
