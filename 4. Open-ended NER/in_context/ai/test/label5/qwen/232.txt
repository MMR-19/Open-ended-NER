Example #1: It also created flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by RMT Robotics to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick and place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and industrial robot arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AGV', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Motivity control system', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'RMT Robotics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ADAM iAGV', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'gantry systems', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'industrial robot arms', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'non-linear layouts', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: One of the metrics used in NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences", 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'summarization', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'translation tasks', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'ROUGE metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Neural Information Processing Systems', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'NIPS', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Canada', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #3: 59, pp. 2547-2553, Oct. 2011 In one dimensional polynomial-based memory (or memoryless) DPD, in order to solve for the digital pre-distorter polynomials coefficients and minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the distorted output of the nonlinear system must be over-sampled at a rate that enables the capture of the nonlinear products of the order of the digital pre-distorter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'one dimensional polynomial-based memory', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DPD', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'MSE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #5: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
