Example #1: A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: Unimation purchased Victor Scheinman ' s Vicarm Inc. in 1977, and with Scheinman's help, the company created and began producing the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly, a new model of robotic arm, and using Scheinman's cutting-edge VAL programming language.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Unimation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Victor Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Vicarm Inc.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'VAL programming language', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'

Example #3: One of the metrics used in NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences", 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'summarization', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'translation tasks', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'ROUGE metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Neural Information Processing Systems', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'NIPS', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Canada', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #4: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #5: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
