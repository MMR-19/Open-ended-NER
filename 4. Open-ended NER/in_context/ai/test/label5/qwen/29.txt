Example #1: The first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company. by KUKA robotics in Germany, and the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly was invented by Victor Scheinman in 1976, and the design was sold to Unimation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'palletizing robot', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'KUKA robotics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Germany', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Victor Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Unimation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: Unimation purchased Victor Scheinman ' s Vicarm Inc. in 1977, and with Scheinman's help, the company created and began producing the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly, a new model of robotic arm, and using Scheinman's cutting-edge VAL programming language.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Unimation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Victor Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Vicarm Inc.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'VAL programming language', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'

Example #3: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: It also created flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by RMT Robotics to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick and place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and industrial robot arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AGV', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Motivity control system', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'RMT Robotics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ADAM iAGV', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'gantry systems', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'industrial robot arms', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'non-linear layouts', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
