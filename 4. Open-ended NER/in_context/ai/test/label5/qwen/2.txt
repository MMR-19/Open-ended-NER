Example #1: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: The speech synthesis is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software Adobe Voco, a prototype slated to be a part of the Adobe Creative Suite and DeepMind WaveNet, a prototype from Google.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Adobe Voco', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Adobe Creative Suite', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'WaveNet', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Google', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #3: Haralick is a Fellow of IEEE for his contributions in computer vision and image processing and a Fellow of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR) for his contributions in pattern recognition, image processing, and for service to IAPR.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Haralick', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'IEEE', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'computer vision', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'image processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'International Association for Pattern Recognition', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'IAPR', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #4: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #5: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
