Example #1: He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Association for the Advancement Artificial Intelligence, and Cognitive Science Society, and an editor of the J. Automated Reasoning, J. Learning Sciences, and J. Applied Ontology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'American Association for the Advancement of Science', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Association for the Advancement Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Cognitive Science Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'J. Automated Reasoning', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'J. Learning Sciences', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'J. Applied Ontology', 'entity': 'Conference'}]'

Example #2: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'computational linguistics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'David Hays', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'International Committee on Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ICCL', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #3: Poggio is an honorary member of the Neuroscience Research Program, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a founding fellow of AAAI and a founding member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poggio', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Neuroscience Research Program', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'McGovern Institute for Brain Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #5: The speech synthesis is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software Adobe Voco, a prototype slated to be a part of the Adobe Creative Suite and DeepMind WaveNet, a prototype from Google.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Adobe Voco', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Adobe Creative Suite', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'WaveNet', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Google', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
