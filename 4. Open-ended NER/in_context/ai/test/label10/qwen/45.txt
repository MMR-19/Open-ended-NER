Example #1: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.

Example #2: Variants of the back-propagation algorithm as well as unsupervised methods by Geoff Hinton and colleagues at the University of Toronto can be used to train deep, highly nonlinear neural architectures, { { cite journal

Example #3: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.

Example #4: With the advent of component-based frameworks such as .NET and Java, component based development environments are capable of deploying the developed neural network to these frameworks as inheritable components.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '.NET', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #5: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #6: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #7: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.

Example #8: Several of these programs are available online, such as Google Translate and the SYSTRAN system that powers AltaVista's BabelFish (now Yahoo's Babelfish as of 9 May 2008).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Google Translate', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'SYSTRAN system', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'AltaVista', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'BabelFish', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Yahoo', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Babelfish', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #9: Beginning at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, films may now be restricted from screening at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto - one of the festival's main venues - and screened elsewhere (such as TIFF Bell Lightbox and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2019 Toronto International Film Festival', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Scotiabank Theatre Toronto', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'TIFF Bell Lightbox', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Netflix', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #10: During the 1990s, encouraged by successes in speech recognition and speech synthesis, research began into speech translation with the development of the German Verbmobil project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech translation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Verbmobil project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
