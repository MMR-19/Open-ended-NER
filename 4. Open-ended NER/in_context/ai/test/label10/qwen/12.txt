Example #1: An optimal value for math \ alpha / math can be found by using a line search algorithm, that is, the magnitude of math \ alpha / math is determined by finding the value that minimizes S, usually using a line search in the interval math0 \ alpha 1 / math or a backtracking line search such as Armijo-line search.

Example #6: One of the metrics used in NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.

Example #7: It also created flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by RMT Robotics to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick and place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and industrial robot arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts.
