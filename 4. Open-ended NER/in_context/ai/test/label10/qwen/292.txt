Example #4: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.

Example #8: Also in regression analysis, mean squared error, often referred to as mean squared prediction error or out-of-sample mean squared error, can refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the TRUE values, over an out-of-sample test space, generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'regression analysis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'mean squared prediction error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'out-of-sample mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'squared deviations', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
