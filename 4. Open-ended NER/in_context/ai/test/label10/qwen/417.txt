Example #1: 59, pp. 2547-2553, Oct. 2011 In one dimensional polynomial-based memory (or memoryless) DPD, in order to solve for the digital pre-distorter polynomials coefficients and minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the distorted output of the nonlinear system must be over-sampled at a rate that enables the capture of the nonlinear products of the order of the digital pre-distorter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'one dimensional polynomial-based memory', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DPD', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'MSE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #4: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.

Example #5: Geometry processing is a common research topic at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics academic conference, and the main topic of the annual Symposium on Geometry Processing.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Geometry processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'SIGGRAPH', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'computer graphics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Symposium on Geometry Processing', 'entity': 'Conference'}]'

Example #6: The speech synthesis is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software Adobe Voco, a prototype slated to be a part of the Adobe Creative Suite and DeepMind WaveNet, a prototype from Google.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Adobe Voco', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Adobe Creative Suite', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'WaveNet', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Google', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #7: With long-time collaborator Laurent Cohen, a neurologist at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, Dehaene also identified patients with lesions in different regions of the parietal lobe with impaired multiplication, but preserved subtraction (associated with lesions of the inferior parietal lobule) and others with impaired subtraction, but preserved multiplication (associated with lesions to the intraparietal sulcus).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Laurent Cohen', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Dehaene', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'parietal lobe', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'inferior parietal lobule', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'intraparietal sulcus', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #8: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #9: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #10: Beginning at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, films may now be restricted from screening at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto - one of the festival's main venues - and screened elsewhere (such as TIFF Bell Lightbox and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2019 Toronto International Film Festival', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Scotiabank Theatre Toronto', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'TIFF Bell Lightbox', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Netflix', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
