Example #1: The speech synthesis is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software Adobe Voco, a prototype slated to be a part of the Adobe Creative Suite and DeepMind WaveNet, a prototype from Google.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Adobe Voco', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Adobe Creative Suite', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'WaveNet', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Google', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: During the 1990s, encouraged by successes in speech recognition and speech synthesis, research began into speech translation with the development of the German Verbmobil project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech translation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Verbmobil project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Some less widely spoken languages use the open-source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech; producing a robotic, awkward voice that may be difficult to understand.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eSpeak synthesizer', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: It also created flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by RMT Robotics to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick and place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and industrial robot arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts.

Example #5: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #6: The sigmoid function s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package sigmoid, with the intention to enable more general use.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sigmoid function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'sigmoid', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #7: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #8: The first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company. by KUKA robotics in Germany, and the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly was invented by Victor Scheinman in 1976, and the design was sold to Unimation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'palletizing robot', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'KUKA robotics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Germany', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Victor Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Unimation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #9: The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) -based systems introduced by Alex Graves of Google DeepMind and Navdeep Jaitly of the University of Toronto in 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'end-to-end ASR', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Connectionist Temporal Classification', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'CTC', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Alex Graves', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Google DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Navdeep Jaitly', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'University of Toronto', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #10: Several of these programs are available online, such as Google Translate and the SYSTRAN system that powers AltaVista's BabelFish (now Yahoo's Babelfish as of 9 May 2008).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Google Translate', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'SYSTRAN system', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'AltaVista', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'BabelFish', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Yahoo', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Babelfish', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
