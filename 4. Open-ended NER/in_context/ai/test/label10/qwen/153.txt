Example #1: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.

Example #2: An optimal value for math \ alpha / math can be found by using a line search algorithm, that is, the magnitude of math \ alpha / math is determined by finding the value that minimizes S, usually using a line search in the interval math0 \ alpha 1 / math or a backtracking line search such as Armijo-line search.

Example #4: 59, pp. 2547-2553, Oct. 2011 In one dimensional polynomial-based memory (or memoryless) DPD, in order to solve for the digital pre-distorter polynomials coefficients and minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the distorted output of the nonlinear system must be over-sampled at a rate that enables the capture of the nonlinear products of the order of the digital pre-distorter.

Example #6: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.

Example #9: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
