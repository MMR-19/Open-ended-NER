Example #1: It also created flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by RMT Robotics to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick and place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and industrial robot arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts.

Example #3: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.

Example #5: A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #6: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.

Example #7: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #8: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).

Example #9: Unimation purchased Victor Scheinman ' s Vicarm Inc. in 1977, and with Scheinman's help, the company created and began producing the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly, a new model of robotic arm, and using Scheinman's cutting-edge VAL programming language.
