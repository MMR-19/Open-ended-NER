Example #1: Also in regression analysis, mean squared error, often referred to as mean squared prediction error or out-of-sample mean squared error, can refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the TRUE values, over an out-of-sample test space, generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space.

Example #2: If we use least squares to fit a function in the form of a hyperplane ŷ = a + β supT / sup x to the data (x sub i / sub, y sub i / sub) sub 1 ≤ i ≤ n / sub, we could then assess the fit using the mean squared error (MSE).

Example #3: 59, pp. 2547-2553, Oct. 2011 In one dimensional polynomial-based memory (or memoryless) DPD, in order to solve for the digital pre-distorter polynomials coefficients and minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the distorted output of the nonlinear system must be over-sampled at a rate that enables the capture of the nonlinear products of the order of the digital pre-distorter.

Example #4: The speech synthesis is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software Adobe Voco, a prototype slated to be a part of the Adobe Creative Suite and DeepMind WaveNet, a prototype from Google.

Example #5: If the signal is further ergodic, all sample paths exhibits the same time-average and thus mathR _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) = \ widehat { R } _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) / math in mean square error sense.

Example #6: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.

Example #8: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).

Example #9: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
