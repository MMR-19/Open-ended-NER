Example #1: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.

Example #2: The inclusion of a C + + interpreter (CINT until version 5.34, Cling from version 6) makes this package very versatile as it can be used in interactive, scripted and compiled modes in a manner similar to commercial products like MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'C + +', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'CINT', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Cling', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: Haralick is a Fellow of IEEE for his contributions in computer vision and image processing and a Fellow of the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR) for his contributions in pattern recognition, image processing, and for service to IAPR.

Example #5: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #6: With the advent of component-based frameworks such as .NET and Java, component based development environments are capable of deploying the developed neural network to these frameworks as inheritable components.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '.NET', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #7: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #8: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #9: More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificially intelligent robots', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Ex Machina', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Westworld', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #10: Applications include object recognition, robotic mapping and navigation, image stitching, 3D modeling, gesture recognition, video tracking, individual identification of wildlife and match moving.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'object recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'robotic mapping', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'navigation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'image stitching', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': '3D modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'gesture recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'video tracking', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'individual identification of wildlife', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'match moving', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
