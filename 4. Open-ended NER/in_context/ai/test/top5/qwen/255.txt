Example #1: Advocates of procedural representations were mainly centered at MIT, under the leadership of Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MIT', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Marvin Minsky', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Seymour Papert', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #2: Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #3: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'computational linguistics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'David Hays', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'International Committee on Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ICCL', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: In 2002 Hutter, with Jürgen Schmidhuber and Shane Legg, developed and published a mathematical theory of artificial general intelligence based on idealised intelligent agents and reward-motivated reinforcement learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hutter', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Shane Legg', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'artificial general intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'intelligent agents', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'
