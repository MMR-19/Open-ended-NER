Example #1: The speech synthesis is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software Adobe Voco, a prototype slated to be a part of the Adobe Creative Suite and DeepMind WaveNet, a prototype from Google.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Adobe Voco', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Adobe Creative Suite', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'WaveNet', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Google', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #3: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #4: The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) -based systems introduced by Alex Graves of Google DeepMind and Navdeep Jaitly of the University of Toronto in 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'end-to-end ASR', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Connectionist Temporal Classification', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'CTC', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Alex Graves', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Google DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Navdeep Jaitly', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'University of Toronto', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #5: Some less widely spoken languages use the open-source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech; producing a robotic, awkward voice that may be difficult to understand.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eSpeak synthesizer', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
