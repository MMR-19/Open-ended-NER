Example #1: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.

Example #2: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a that is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Octave', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: Examples of supervised learning are Naive Bayes classifier, Support vector machine, mixtures of Gaussians, and network.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'supervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Naive Bayes classifier', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Support vector machine', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'mixtures of Gaussians', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #5: Unimation purchased Victor Scheinman ' s Vicarm Inc. in 1977, and with Scheinman's help, the company created and began producing the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly, a new model of robotic arm, and using Scheinman's cutting-edge VAL programming language.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Unimation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Victor Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Vicarm Inc.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'VAL programming language', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'
