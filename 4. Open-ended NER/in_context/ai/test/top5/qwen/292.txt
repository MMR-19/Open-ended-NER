Example #1: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #2: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'computational linguistics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'David Hays', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'International Committee on Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ICCL', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: In 2002 Hutter, with Jürgen Schmidhuber and Shane Legg, developed and published a mathematical theory of artificial general intelligence based on idealised intelligent agents and reward-motivated reinforcement learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hutter', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Shane Legg', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'artificial general intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'intelligent agents', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #5: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
