Example #1: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #2: Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #3: Advocates of procedural representations were mainly centered at MIT, under the leadership of Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MIT', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Marvin Minsky', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Seymour Papert', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: Between 2009 and 2012, the recurrent neural network s and deep feedforward neural network s developed in the research group of Jürgen Schmidhuber at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA have won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recurrent neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'deep feedforward neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Swiss AI Lab IDSIA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #5: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
