Example #1: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #3: The most common way is using the so-called ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measure.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ROUGE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #5: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
