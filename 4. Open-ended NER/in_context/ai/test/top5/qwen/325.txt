Example #1: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #2: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #3: Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #4: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #5: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
