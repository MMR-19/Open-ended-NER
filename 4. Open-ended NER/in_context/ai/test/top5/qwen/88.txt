Example #1: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #2: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'computational linguistics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'David Hays', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'International Committee on Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ICCL', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #3: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: CycL in computer science and artificial intelligence is an ontology language used by Doug Lenat's Cyc artificial project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CycL', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'computer science', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'artificial intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'ontology language', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Doug Lenat', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Cyc artificial project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
