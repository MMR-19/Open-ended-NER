Example #1: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: One of the metrics used in NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences", 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'summarization', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'translation tasks', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'ROUGE metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Neural Information Processing Systems', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'NIPS', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Canada', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #3: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #5: The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'precision', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'recall', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
