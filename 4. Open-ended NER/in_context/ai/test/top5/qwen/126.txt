Example #1: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #3: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #5: Voice user interfaces that interpret and manage conversational state are challenging to design due to the inherent difficulty of integrating complex natural language processing tasks like coreference resolution, named-entity recognition, information retrieval, and dialog management.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voice user interfaces', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'coreference resolution', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'named-entity recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'dialog management', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
