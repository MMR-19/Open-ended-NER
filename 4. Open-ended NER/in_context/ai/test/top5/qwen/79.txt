Example #1: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: In digital signal processing and information theory, the normalized sinc function is commonly defined for by
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'digital signal processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'information theory', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'normalized sinc function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #5: The most common way is using the so-called ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measure.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ROUGE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
