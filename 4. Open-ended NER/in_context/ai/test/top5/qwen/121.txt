Example #1: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #3: Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grammar checkers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'word processor', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'computational linguistics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'David Hays', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'International Committee on Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ICCL', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: Some less widely spoken languages use the open-source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech; producing a robotic, awkward voice that may be difficult to understand.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eSpeak synthesizer', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
