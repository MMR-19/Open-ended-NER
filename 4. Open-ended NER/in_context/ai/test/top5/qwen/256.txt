Example #1: He holds a D.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering (2000) from Inria and the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, and has held permanent positions at Siemens Corporate Technology, École des ponts ParisTech as well as visiting positions at Rutgers University, Yale University and University of Houston.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'D.Sc. degree', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'electrical and computer engineering', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Inria', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'University of Nice Sophia Antipolis', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Siemens Corporate Technology', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'École des ponts ParisTech', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Rutgers University', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Yale University', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Houston', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #2: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #3: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #5: In digital signal processing and information theory, the normalized sinc function is commonly defined for by
