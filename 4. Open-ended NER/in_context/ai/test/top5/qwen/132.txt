Example #1: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: A fast method for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the probit model was proposed by Ronald Fisher as an appendix to Bliss ' work in 1935.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'maximum likelihood', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'probit model', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Ronald Fisher', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Bliss', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #3: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: The most common way is using the so-called ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measure.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ROUGE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #5: Sigmoid function Cross entropy loss is used for predicting K independent probability values in math 0,1 / math.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sigmoid function Cross entropy loss', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
