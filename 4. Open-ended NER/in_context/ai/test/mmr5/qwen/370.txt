Example #1: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: Descendants of the CLIPS language include Jess (rule-based portion of CLIPS rewritten in Java, it later grew up in different direction), JESS was originally inspired
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CLIPS', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Jess', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'JESS', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'

Example #3: If we use least squares to fit a function in the form of a hyperplane ŷ = a + β supT / sup x to the data (x sub i / sub, y sub i / sub) sub 1 ≤ i ≤ n / sub, we could then assess the fit using the mean squared error (MSE).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'least squares', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'MSE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: or equivalently using DCG notation:
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
