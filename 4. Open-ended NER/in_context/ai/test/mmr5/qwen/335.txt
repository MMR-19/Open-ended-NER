Example #1: CycL in computer science and artificial intelligence is an ontology language used by Doug Lenat's Cyc artificial project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CycL', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'computer science', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'artificial intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'ontology language', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Doug Lenat', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Cyc artificial project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Poggio is an honorary member of the Neuroscience Research Program, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a founding fellow of AAAI and a founding member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poggio', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Neuroscience Research Program', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'McGovern Institute for Brain Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: In 2002 Hutter, with Jürgen Schmidhuber and Shane Legg, developed and published a mathematical theory of artificial general intelligence based on idealised intelligent agents and reward-motivated reinforcement learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hutter', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Shane Legg', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'artificial general intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'intelligent agents', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #5: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
