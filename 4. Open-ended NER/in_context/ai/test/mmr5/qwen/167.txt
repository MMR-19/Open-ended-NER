Example #1: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: Another technique particularly used for recurrent neural network s is the long short-term memory (LSTM) network of 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter & Jürgen Schmidhuber.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recurrent neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'long short-term memory', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'LSTM', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Sepp Hochreiter', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: Eurisko made many interesting discoveries and enjoyed significant acclaim, with his paper Heuretics: Theoretical and Study of Heuristic Rules winning the Best Paper award at the 1982 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Eurisko', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Heuretics: Theoretical and Study of Heuristic Rules', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Best Paper award', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': '1982 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Conference'}]'

Example #5: The National Science Foundation was an umbrella for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Energy, the US Department of Commerce NIST, the US Department of Defense, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Office of Naval Research coordinated studies to inform strategic planners in their deliberations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'National Science Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'NASA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Energy', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Commerce NIST', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Defense', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'DARPA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Office of Naval Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
