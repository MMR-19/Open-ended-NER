Example #1: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Neuroevolution', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #2: More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificially intelligent robots', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Ex Machina', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Westworld', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Eurisko made many interesting discoveries and enjoyed significant acclaim, with his paper Heuretics: Theoretical and Study of Heuristic Rules winning the Best Paper award at the 1982 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Eurisko', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Heuretics: Theoretical and Study of Heuristic Rules', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Best Paper award', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': '1982 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Conference'}]'

Example #4: Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #5: Poggio is an honorary member of the Neuroscience Research Program, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a founding fellow of AAAI and a founding member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poggio', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Neuroscience Research Program', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'McGovern Institute for Brain Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
