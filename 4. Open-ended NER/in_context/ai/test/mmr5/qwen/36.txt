Example #1: Sigmoid function Cross entropy loss is used for predicting K independent probability values in math 0,1 / math.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sigmoid function Cross entropy loss', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: In 2002 Hutter, with Jürgen Schmidhuber and Shane Legg, developed and published a mathematical theory of artificial general intelligence based on idealised intelligent agents and reward-motivated reinforcement learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hutter', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Shane Legg', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'artificial general intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'intelligent agents', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #4: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #5: If the signal is further ergodic, all sample paths exhibits the same time-average and thus mathR _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) = \ widehat { R } _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) / math in mean square error sense.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'mean square error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
