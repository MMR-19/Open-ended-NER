Example #1: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: Feature extraction and dimension reduction can be combined in one step using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or canonical correlation analysis (CCA) techniques as a pre-processing step, followed by clustering by k -NN on feature vectors in reduced-dimension space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Feature extraction', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'dimension reduction', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Principal Component Analysis', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'PCA', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'linear discriminant analysis', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'LDA', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'canonical correlation analysis', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'CCA', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'pre-processing', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'k -NN', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #3: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grammar checkers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'word processor', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #5: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
