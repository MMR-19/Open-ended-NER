Example #1: The standard interface and calculator interface are written in Java.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'

Example #2: Poggio is an honorary member of the Neuroscience Research Program, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a founding fellow of AAAI and a founding member of the McGovern Institute for Brain Research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Poggio', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Neuroscience Research Program', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'American Academy of Arts and Sciences', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'McGovern Institute for Brain Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #3: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #4: Beginning at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, films may now be restricted from screening at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto - one of the festival's main venues - and screened elsewhere (such as TIFF Bell Lightbox and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2019 Toronto International Film Festival', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Scotiabank Theatre Toronto', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'TIFF Bell Lightbox', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Netflix', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #5: 59, pp. 2547-2553, Oct. 2011 In one dimensional polynomial-based memory (or memoryless) DPD, in order to solve for the digital pre-distorter polynomials coefficients and minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the distorted output of the nonlinear system must be over-sampled at a rate that enables the capture of the nonlinear products of the order of the digital pre-distorter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'one dimensional polynomial-based memory', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DPD', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'MSE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
