Example #1: The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'precision', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'recall', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: To allow for multiple entities, a separate Hinge loss is computed for each capsule.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hinge loss', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: Some less widely spoken languages use the open-source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech; producing a robotic, awkward voice that may be difficult to understand.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eSpeak synthesizer', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: Also in regression analysis, mean squared error, often referred to as mean squared prediction error or out-of-sample mean squared error, can refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the TRUE values, over an out-of-sample test space, generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'regression analysis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'mean squared prediction error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'out-of-sample mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'squared deviations', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'
