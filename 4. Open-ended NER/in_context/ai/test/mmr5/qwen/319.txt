Example #1: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: Over the past decade, PCNNs have been used in a variety of image processing applications, including: image segmentation, feature generation, face extraction, motion detection, region growing, and noise reduction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'PCNNs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'image processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'image segmentation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'feature generation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'face extraction', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'motion detection', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'region growing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'noise reduction', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #4: It also created flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by RMT Robotics to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick and place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and industrial robot arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AGV', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Motivity control system', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'RMT Robotics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ADAM iAGV', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'gantry systems', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'industrial robot arms', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'non-linear layouts', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: He received two honorary degree s, one S. V. della laurea ad honorem in Psychology from the University of Padua in 1995 and one doctorate in Industrial Design and Engineering from Delft University of Technology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'S. V. della laurea ad honorem', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Psychology', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'University of Padua', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Industrial Design and Engineering', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Delft University of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}]'
