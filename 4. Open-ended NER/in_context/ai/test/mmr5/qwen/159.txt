Example #1: With the emergence of conversational assistants such as Apple's Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana, and Samsung's Bixby, Voice Portals can now be accessed through mobile devices and Far Field voice smart speakers such as the Amazon Echo and Google Home.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "Apple's Siri", 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Amazon Alexa', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Google Assistant', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Microsoft Cortana', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': "Samsung's Bixby", 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Voice Portals', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Far Field voice smart speakers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Amazon Echo', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Google Home', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: Geometry processing is a common research topic at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics academic conference, and the main topic of the annual Symposium on Geometry Processing.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Geometry processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'SIGGRAPH', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'computer graphics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Symposium on Geometry Processing', 'entity': 'Conference'}]'

Example #4: Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #5: Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grammar checkers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'word processor', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
