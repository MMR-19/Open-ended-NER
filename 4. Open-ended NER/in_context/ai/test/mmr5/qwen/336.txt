Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: Lafferty received numerous awards, including two Test-of-Time awards at the International Conference on Machine Learning 2011 & 2012,
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lafferty', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Test-of-Time awards', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'International Conference on Machine Learning 2011 & 2012', 'entity': 'Conference'}]'

Example #3: During the 1990s, encouraged by successes in speech recognition and speech synthesis, research began into speech translation with the development of the German Verbmobil project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech translation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Verbmobil project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #5: A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
