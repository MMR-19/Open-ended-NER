Example #1: Some less widely spoken languages use the open-source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech; producing a robotic, awkward voice that may be difficult to understand.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eSpeak synthesizer', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: Several of these programs are available online, such as Google Translate and the SYSTRAN system that powers AltaVista's BabelFish (now Yahoo's Babelfish as of 9 May 2008).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Google Translate', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'SYSTRAN system', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'AltaVista', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'BabelFish', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Yahoo', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Babelfish', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) -based systems introduced by Alex Graves of Google DeepMind and Navdeep Jaitly of the University of Toronto in 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'end-to-end ASR', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Connectionist Temporal Classification', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'CTC', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Alex Graves', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Google DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Navdeep Jaitly', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'University of Toronto', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #4: During the 1990s, encouraged by successes in speech recognition and speech synthesis, research began into speech translation with the development of the German Verbmobil project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech translation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Verbmobil project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: The sigmoid function s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package sigmoid, with the intention to enable more general use.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sigmoid function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'sigmoid', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
