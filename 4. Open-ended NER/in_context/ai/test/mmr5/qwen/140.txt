Example #1: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'computational linguistics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'David Hays', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'International Committee on Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ICCL', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificially intelligent robots', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Ex Machina', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Westworld', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn Feature learning in an unsupervised learning manner.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'autoencoder', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'artificial neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Feature learning', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'unsupervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #5: He received two honorary degree s, one S. V. della laurea ad honorem in Psychology from the University of Padua in 1995 and one doctorate in Industrial Design and Engineering from Delft University of Technology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'S. V. della laurea ad honorem', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Psychology', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'University of Padua', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Industrial Design and Engineering', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Delft University of Technology', 'entity': 'University'}]'
