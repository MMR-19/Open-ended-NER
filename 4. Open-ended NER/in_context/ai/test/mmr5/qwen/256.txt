Example #1: He holds a D.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering (2000) from Inria and the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, and has held permanent positions at Siemens Corporate Technology, École des ponts ParisTech as well as visiting positions at Rutgers University, Yale University and University of Houston.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'D.Sc. degree', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'electrical and computer engineering', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Inria', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'University of Nice Sophia Antipolis', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Siemens Corporate Technology', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'École des ponts ParisTech', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Rutgers University', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Yale University', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Houston', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #2: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #3: If the signal is further ergodic, all sample paths exhibits the same time-average and thus mathR _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) = \ widehat { R } _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) / math in mean square error sense.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'mean square error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: The Walt Disney Company also began more prominent use of 3D films in special venues to impress audiences with Magic Journeys (1982) and Captain EO (Francis Ford Coppola, 1986, starring Michael Jackson) being notable examples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The Walt Disney Company', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Magic Journeys', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Captain EO', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Michael Jackson', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #5: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
