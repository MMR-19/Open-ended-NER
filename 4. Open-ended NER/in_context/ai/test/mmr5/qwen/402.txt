Example #1: An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn Feature learning in an unsupervised learning manner.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'autoencoder', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'artificial neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Feature learning', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'unsupervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #2: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: 59, pp. 2547-2553, Oct. 2011 In one dimensional polynomial-based memory (or memoryless) DPD, in order to solve for the digital pre-distorter polynomials coefficients and minimize the mean squared error (MSE), the distorted output of the nonlinear system must be over-sampled at a rate that enables the capture of the nonlinear products of the order of the digital pre-distorter.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'one dimensional polynomial-based memory', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'DPD', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'MSE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #5: To allow for multiple entities, a separate Hinge loss is computed for each capsule.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hinge loss', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
