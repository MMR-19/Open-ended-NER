Example #1: The first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company. by KUKA robotics in Germany, and the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly was invented by Victor Scheinman in 1976, and the design was sold to Unimation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'palletizing robot', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'KUKA robotics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Germany', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Victor Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Unimation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: Over the past decade, PCNNs have been used in a variety of image processing applications, including: image segmentation, feature generation, face extraction, motion detection, region growing, and noise reduction.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'PCNNs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'image processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'image segmentation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'feature generation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'face extraction', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'motion detection', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'region growing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'noise reduction', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #3: The parameters β are typically estimated by maximum likelihood.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'maximum likelihood', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #5: Some less widely spoken languages use the open-source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech; producing a robotic, awkward voice that may be difficult to understand.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eSpeak synthesizer', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
