Example #1: The Walt Disney Company also began more prominent use of 3D films in special venues to impress audiences with Magic Journeys (1982) and Captain EO (Francis Ford Coppola, 1986, starring Michael Jackson) being notable examples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The Walt Disney Company', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Magic Journeys', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Captain EO', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Michael Jackson', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #2: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'
