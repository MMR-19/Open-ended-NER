Example #1: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: The most common way is using the so-called ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measure.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'ROUGE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
