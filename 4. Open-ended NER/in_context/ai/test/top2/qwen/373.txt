Example #1: With the advent of component-based frameworks such as .NET and Java, component based development environments are capable of deploying the developed neural network to these frameworks as inheritable components.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '.NET', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #2: An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn Feature learning in an unsupervised learning manner.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'autoencoder', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'artificial neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Feature learning', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'unsupervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'
