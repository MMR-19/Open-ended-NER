Example #1: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
