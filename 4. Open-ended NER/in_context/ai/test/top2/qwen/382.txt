Example #1: DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DeepFace', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'facial recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Facebook', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: With the advent of component-based frameworks such as .NET and Java, component based development environments are capable of deploying the developed neural network to these frameworks as inheritable components.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '.NET', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
