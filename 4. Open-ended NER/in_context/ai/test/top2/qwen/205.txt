Example #1: Artificial neural networks are computational models that excel at machine learning and pattern recognition.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #2: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
