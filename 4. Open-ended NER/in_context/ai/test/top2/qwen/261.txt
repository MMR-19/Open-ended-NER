Example #1: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #2: Advocates of procedural representations were mainly centered at MIT, under the leadership of Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MIT', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Marvin Minsky', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Seymour Papert', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'
