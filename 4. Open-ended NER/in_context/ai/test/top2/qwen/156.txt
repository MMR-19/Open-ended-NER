Example #1: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.

Example #2: Eurisko made many interesting discoveries and enjoyed significant acclaim, with his paper Heuretics: Theoretical and Study of Heuristic Rules winning the Best Paper award at the 1982 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.
