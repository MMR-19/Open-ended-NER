Example #1: The National Science Foundation was an umbrella for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Energy, the US Department of Commerce NIST, the US Department of Defense, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Office of Naval Research coordinated studies to inform strategic planners in their deliberations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'National Science Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'NASA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Energy', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Commerce NIST', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Defense', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'DARPA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Office of Naval Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #2: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
