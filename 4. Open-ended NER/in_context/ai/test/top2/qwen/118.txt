Example #1: An optimal value for math \ alpha / math can be found by using a line search algorithm, that is, the magnitude of math \ alpha / math is determined by finding the value that minimizes S, usually using a line search in the interval math0 \ alpha 1 / math or a backtracking line search such as Armijo-line search.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'line search algorithm', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backtracking line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Armijo-line search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #2: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
