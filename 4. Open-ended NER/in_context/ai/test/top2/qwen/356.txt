Example #1: Advocates of procedural representations were mainly centered at MIT, under the leadership of Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'MIT', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Marvin Minsky', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Seymour Papert', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #2: Between 2009 and 2012, the recurrent neural network s and deep feedforward neural network s developed in the research group of Jürgen Schmidhuber at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA have won eight international competitions in pattern recognition and machine learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recurrent neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'deep feedforward neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Swiss AI Lab IDSIA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'pattern recognition', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'machine learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'
