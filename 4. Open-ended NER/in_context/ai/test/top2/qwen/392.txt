Example #1: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: Two of the main methods used in unsupervised learning are principal component analysis and cluster analysis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'unsupervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'principal component analysis', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'cluster analysis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
