Example #1: Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a that is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Octave', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
