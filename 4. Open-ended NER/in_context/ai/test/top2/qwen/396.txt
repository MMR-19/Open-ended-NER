Example #1: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
