Example #1: Octave helps in solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing other numerical experiments using a that is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Octave', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #2: The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'precision', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'recall', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: Also in regression analysis, mean squared error, often referred to as mean squared prediction error or out-of-sample mean squared error, can refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the TRUE values, over an out-of-sample test space, generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'regression analysis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'mean squared prediction error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'out-of-sample mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'squared deviations', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: In digital signal processing and information theory, the normalized sinc function is commonly defined for by
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'digital signal processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'information theory', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'normalized sinc function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #6: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #7: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #8: This math \ theta ^ { * } / math is normally estimated using a Maximum Likelihood (math \ theta ^ { * } = \ theta ^ { ML } / math) or Maximum A Posteriori (math \ theta ^ { * } = \ theta ^ { MAP } / math) procedure.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Maximum Likelihood', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Maximum A Posteriori', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'MAP', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #9: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #10: If the signal is further ergodic, all sample paths exhibits the same time-average and thus mathR _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) = \ widehat { R } _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) / math in mean square error sense.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'mean square error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
