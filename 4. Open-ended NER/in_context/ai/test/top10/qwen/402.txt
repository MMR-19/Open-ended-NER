Example #1: An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn Feature learning in an unsupervised learning manner.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'autoencoder', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'artificial neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Feature learning', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'unsupervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #2: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #3: Sigmoid function Cross entropy loss is used for predicting K independent probability values in math 0,1 / math.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sigmoid function Cross entropy loss', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #5: The first attempt at end-to-end ASR was with Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) -based systems introduced by Alex Graves of Google DeepMind and Navdeep Jaitly of the University of Toronto in 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'end-to-end ASR', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Connectionist Temporal Classification', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'CTC', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Alex Graves', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Google DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Navdeep Jaitly', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'University of Toronto', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #6: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #7: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Neuroevolution', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #8: To allow for multiple entities, a separate Hinge loss is computed for each capsule.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hinge loss', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #9: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #10: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
