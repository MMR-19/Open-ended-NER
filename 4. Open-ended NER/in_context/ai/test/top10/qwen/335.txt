Example #6: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.

Example #9: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'
