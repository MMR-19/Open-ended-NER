Example #1: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.

Example #3: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: CycL in computer science and artificial intelligence is an ontology language used by Doug Lenat's Cyc artificial project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CycL', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'computer science', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'artificial intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'ontology language', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Doug Lenat', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Cyc artificial project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #6: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #7: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #8: One of the metrics used in NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences", 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'summarization', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'translation tasks', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'ROUGE metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Neural Information Processing Systems', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'NIPS', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Canada', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #9: Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grammar checkers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'word processor', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #10: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
