Example #1: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grammar checkers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'word processor', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #4: J48 is an open source Java implementation of the C4.5 algorithm in the Weka data mining tool.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'J48', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'C4.5 algorithm', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Weka data mining tool', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #5: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #6: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #7: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #8: The standard interface and calculator interface are written in Java.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'

Example #9: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #10: The technique used in creating eigenfaces and using them for recognition is also used outside of face recognition: handwriting recognition, lip reading, voice recognition, sign language / hand gestures interpretation and medical imaging analysis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eigenfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'face recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'handwriting recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'lip reading', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'voice recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'sign language', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'hand gestures interpretation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'medical imaging analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}]'
