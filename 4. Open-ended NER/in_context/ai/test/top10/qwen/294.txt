Example #5: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #6: Unimation purchased Victor Scheinman ' s Vicarm Inc. in 1977, and with Scheinman's help, the company created and began producing the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly, a new model of robotic arm, and using Scheinman's cutting-edge VAL programming language.

Example #7: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
