Example #2: In the middle of the 1990s, while serving as president of the AAAI, Hayes began a series of attacks on critics of AI, mostly phrased in an ironic light, and (together with his colleague Kenneth Ford) invented an award named after Simon Newcomb to be given for the most ridiculous argument disproving the possibility of AI.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AAAI', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Hayes', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'AI', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Kenneth Ford', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Simon Newcomb', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #3: During the 1990s, encouraged by successes in speech recognition and speech synthesis, research began into speech translation with the development of the German Verbmobil project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech translation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Verbmobil project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #4: One of the metrics used in NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, In Advances of Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montreal, Canada, December - 2014.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': "NIST ' s annual Document Understanding Conferences", 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'summarization', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'translation tasks', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'ROUGE metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Neural Information Processing Systems', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'NIPS', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'Montreal', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Canada', 'entity': 'Country'}]'

Example #5: Beginning at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, films may now be restricted from screening at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto - one of the festival's main venues - and screened elsewhere (such as TIFF Bell Lightbox and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2019 Toronto International Film Festival', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Scotiabank Theatre Toronto', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'TIFF Bell Lightbox', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Netflix', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #6: Eurisko made many interesting discoveries and enjoyed significant acclaim, with his paper Heuretics: Theoretical and Study of Heuristic Rules winning the Best Paper award at the 1982 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Eurisko', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Heuretics: Theoretical and Study of Heuristic Rules', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Best Paper award', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': '1982 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Conference'}]'

Example #7: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #8: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #9: Voice user interfaces that interpret and manage conversational state are challenging to design due to the inherent difficulty of integrating complex natural language processing tasks like coreference resolution, named-entity recognition, information retrieval, and dialog management.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Voice user interfaces', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'coreference resolution', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'named-entity recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'dialog management', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #10: The speech synthesis is verging on being completely indistinguishable from a real human's voice with the 2016 introduction of the voice editing and generation software Adobe Voco, a prototype slated to be a part of the Adobe Creative Suite and DeepMind WaveNet, a prototype from Google.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Adobe Voco', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Adobe Creative Suite', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'DeepMind', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'WaveNet', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Google', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
