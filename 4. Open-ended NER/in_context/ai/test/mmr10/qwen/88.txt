Example #1: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.

Example #2: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #3: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grammar checkers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'word processor', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #5: Several other features that helped put 3D back on the map that month were the John Wayne feature Hondo (distributed by Warner Bros.), Columbia's Miss Sadie Thompson with Rita Hayworth, and Paramount's Money From Home with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'John Wayne', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Hondo', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Warner Bros.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Columbia', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Miss Sadie Thompson', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Rita Hayworth', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Paramount', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Money From Home', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Dean Martin', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Jerry Lewis', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #6: DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DeepFace', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'facial recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Facebook', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #7: Descendants of the CLIPS language include Jess (rule-based portion of CLIPS rewritten in Java, it later grew up in different direction), JESS was originally inspired
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CLIPS', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Jess', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'JESS', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'

Example #8: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #9: The term computational linguistics itself was first coined by David Hays, a founding member of both the Association for Computational Linguistics and the International Committee on Computational Linguistics (ICCL).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'computational linguistics', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'David Hays', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Association for Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'International Committee on Computational Linguistics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ICCL', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #10: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'
