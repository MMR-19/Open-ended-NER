Example #1: Also in regression analysis, mean squared error, often referred to as mean squared prediction error or out-of-sample mean squared error, can refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the TRUE values, over an out-of-sample test space, generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space.

Example #3: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #5: As for the results, the C-HOG and R-HOG block descriptors perform comparably, with the C-HOG descriptors maintaining a slight advantage in the detection miss rate at fixed FALSE positive rate s across both data sets.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'C-HOG', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R-HOG', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'C-HOG descriptors', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'FALSE positive rate', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #6: The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method.

Example #9: Some less widely spoken languages use the open-source eSpeak synthesizer for their speech; producing a robotic, awkward voice that may be difficult to understand.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'eSpeak synthesizer', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #10: Beginning at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, films may now be restricted from screening at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto - one of the festival's main venues - and screened elsewhere (such as TIFF Bell Lightbox and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix.
