Example #1: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'precision', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'recall', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: If the signal is further ergodic, all sample paths exhibits the same time-average and thus mathR _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) = \ widehat { R } _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) / math in mean square error sense.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'mean square error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #5: Lafferty received numerous awards, including two Test-of-Time awards at the International Conference on Machine Learning 2011 & 2012,
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Lafferty', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Test-of-Time awards', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'International Conference on Machine Learning 2011 & 2012', 'entity': 'Conference'}]'

Example #6: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #7: Although used mainly by statisticians and other practitioners requiring an environment for statistical computation and software development, R can also operate as a general matrix calculation toolbox - with performance benchmarks comparable to GNU Octave or MATLAB.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'GNU Octave', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'MATLAB', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #8: As for the results, the C-HOG and R-HOG block descriptors perform comparably, with the C-HOG descriptors maintaining a slight advantage in the detection miss rate at fixed FALSE positive rate s across both data sets.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'C-HOG', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R-HOG', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'C-HOG descriptors', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'FALSE positive rate', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #9: The parameters β are typically estimated by maximum likelihood.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'maximum likelihood', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #10: With long-time collaborator Laurent Cohen, a neurologist at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, Dehaene also identified patients with lesions in different regions of the parietal lobe with impaired multiplication, but preserved subtraction (associated with lesions of the inferior parietal lobule) and others with impaired subtraction, but preserved multiplication (associated with lesions to the intraparietal sulcus).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Laurent Cohen', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Dehaene', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'parietal lobe', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'inferior parietal lobule', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'intraparietal sulcus', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
