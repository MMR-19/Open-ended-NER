Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #8: DeepFace is a deep learning facial recognition system created by a research group at Facebook.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DeepFace', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'facial recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Facebook', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #9: To allow for multiple entities, a separate Hinge loss is computed for each capsule.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hinge loss', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #10: More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.
