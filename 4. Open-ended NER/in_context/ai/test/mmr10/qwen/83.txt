Example #1: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #3: Beginning at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, films may now be restricted from screening at Scotiabank Theatre Toronto - one of the festival's main venues - and screened elsewhere (such as TIFF Bell Lightbox and other local cinemas) if distributed by a service such as Netflix.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': '2019 Toronto International Film Festival', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Scotiabank Theatre Toronto', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'TIFF Bell Lightbox', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Netflix', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #4: It also created flexible intelligent AGV applications, designing the Motivity control system used by RMT Robotics to develop its ADAM iAGV (Self-Guided Vehicle), used for complex pick and place operations, in conjunction with gantry systems and industrial robot arms, used in first-tier auto supply factories to move products from process to process in non-linear layouts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'AGV', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Motivity control system', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'RMT Robotics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'ADAM iAGV', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'gantry systems', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'industrial robot arms', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'non-linear layouts', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #6: In 2002 Hutter, with Jürgen Schmidhuber and Shane Legg, developed and published a mathematical theory of artificial general intelligence based on idealised intelligent agents and reward-motivated reinforcement learning.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Hutter', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Jürgen Schmidhuber', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Shane Legg', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'artificial general intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'intelligent agents', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #7: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #8: More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificially intelligent robots', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Ex Machina', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Westworld', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #9: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #10: As for the results, the C-HOG and R-HOG block descriptors perform comparably, with the C-HOG descriptors maintaining a slight advantage in the detection miss rate at fixed FALSE positive rate s across both data sets.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'C-HOG', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R-HOG', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'C-HOG descriptors', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'FALSE positive rate', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'
