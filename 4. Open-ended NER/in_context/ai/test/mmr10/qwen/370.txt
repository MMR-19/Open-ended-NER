Example #1: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #2: Descendants of the CLIPS language include Jess (rule-based portion of CLIPS rewritten in Java, it later grew up in different direction), JESS was originally inspired
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CLIPS', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Jess', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'JESS', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}]'

Example #3: If we use least squares to fit a function in the form of a hyperplane ŷ = a + β supT / sup x to the data (x sub i / sub, y sub i / sub) sub 1 ≤ i ≤ n / sub, we could then assess the fit using the mean squared error (MSE).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'least squares', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'MSE', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: The 2004 SSIM paper has been cited over 20,000 times according to Google Scholar, It also received the IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award for 2016, indicative of a paper having an unusually high impact for at least 10 years following its publication.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'SSIM', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'Google Scholar', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'IEEE Signal Processing Society Sustained Impact Award', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: or equivalently using DCG notation:
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #6: A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #7: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #8: Heterodyning is a signal processing technique invented by Canadian inventor-engineer Reginald Fessenden that creates new frequencies by combining mixing two frequencies.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Heterodyning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'signal processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Canadian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Reginald Fessenden', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #9: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #10: Linear-fractional programming (LFP) is a generalization of linear programming (LP).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Linear-fractional programming', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'LFP', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'linear programming', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'LP', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'
