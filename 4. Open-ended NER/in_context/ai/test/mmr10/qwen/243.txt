Example #2: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #3: Two of the main methods used in unsupervised learning are principal component analysis and cluster analysis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'unsupervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'principal component analysis', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'cluster analysis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #4: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #5: Linear-fractional programming (LFP) is a generalization of linear programming (LP).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Linear-fractional programming', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'LFP', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'linear programming', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'LP', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #6: Also in regression analysis, mean squared error, often referred to as mean squared prediction error or out-of-sample mean squared error, can refer to the mean value of the squared deviations of the predictions from the TRUE values, over an out-of-sample test space, generated by a model estimated over a particular sample space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'regression analysis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'mean squared prediction error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'out-of-sample mean squared error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'squared deviations', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #7: The input is called speech recognition and the output is called speech synthesis.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #8: Neuroevolution is commonly used as part of the reinforcement learning paradigm, and it can be contrasted with conventional deep learning techniques that use gradient descent on a neural network with a fixed topology.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Neuroevolution', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'reinforcement learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'deep learning', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #9: Sigmoid function Cross entropy loss is used for predicting K independent probability values in math 0,1 / math.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Sigmoid function Cross entropy loss', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #10: Self-organizing maps differ from other artificial neural networks as they apply competitive learning as opposed to error-correction learning such as backpropagation with gradient descent), and in the sense that they use a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificial neural networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'competitive learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'error-correction learning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'backpropagation', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'gradient descent', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'topological properties', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'
