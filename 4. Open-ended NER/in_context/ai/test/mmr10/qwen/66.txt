Example #1: CycL in computer science and artificial intelligence is an ontology language used by Doug Lenat's Cyc artificial project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'CycL', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'computer science', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'artificial intelligence', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'ontology language', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Doug Lenat', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Cyc artificial project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #2: The task of recognizing named entities in text is Named Entity Recognition while the task of determining the identity of the named entities mentioned in text is called Entity Linking.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'recognizing named entities in text', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Named Entity Recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Entity Linking', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #3: tity contains a collection of visualization tools and algorithms for data analysis and predictive modeling, together with graphical user interfaces for easy access to these functions. but the more recent fully Java -based version (Weka 3), for which development started in 1997, is now used in many different application areas, in particular for educational purposes and research.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'tity', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'data analysis', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'predictive modeling', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'graphical user interfaces', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Java', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'Weka 3', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: Since 2002, perceptron training has become popular in the field of natural language processing for such tasks as part-of-speech tagging and syntactic parsing (Collins, 2002).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'natural language processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'part-of-speech tagging', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'syntactic parsing', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'Collins', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'

Example #5: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #6: An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn Feature learning in an unsupervised learning manner.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'autoencoder', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'artificial neural network', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Feature learning', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'unsupervised learning', 'entity': 'Field'}]'

Example #7: Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grammar checkers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'word processor', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #8: or equivalently using DCG notation:
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #9: More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such as A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina and the 2016 TV adaptation of Westworld have engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'artificially intelligent robots', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'A.I. Artificial Intelligence', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Ex Machina', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Westworld', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #10: The National Science Foundation was an umbrella for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US Department of Energy, the US Department of Commerce NIST, the US Department of Defense, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and the Office of Naval Research coordinated studies to inform strategic planners in their deliberations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'National Science Foundation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'NASA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Energy', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Commerce NIST', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'US Department of Defense', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'DARPA', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Office of Naval Research', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'
