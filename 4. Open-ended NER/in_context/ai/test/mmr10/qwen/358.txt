Example #1: The NIST metric is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'NIST metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'BLEU metric', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #2: , C. Papageorgiou and T. Poggio, A Trainable Pedestrian Detection system, International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), pages 1: 15-33, 2000 others uses local features like histogram of oriented gradients N. Dalal, B. Triggs, Histograms of oriented gradients for human detection, IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), pages 1: 886-893, 2005 descriptors.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'C. Papageorgiou', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'T. Poggio', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Trainable Pedestrian Detection system', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'International Journal of Computer Vision', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'IJCV', 'entity': 'Conference'}, {'span': 'histogram of oriented gradients', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'N.

Example #3: He discusses Breadth-first search and Depth-first search techniques, but eventually concludes that the results represent expert system s that incarnate a lot of technical knowledge but don 't shine much light on the mental processes that humans use to solve such puzzles.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Breadth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'Depth-first search', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'expert system', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #4: During the 1990s, encouraged by successes in speech recognition and speech synthesis, research began into speech translation with the development of the German Verbmobil project.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech translation', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'German', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Verbmobil project', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #5: As with BLEU, the basic unit of evaluation is the sentence, the algorithm first creates an alignment (see illustrations) between two sentence s, the candidate translation string, and the reference translation string.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'BLEU', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #6: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #7: Grammar checkers are most often implemented as a feature of a larger program, such as a word processor, but are also available as a stand-alone application that can be activated from within programs that work with editable text.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Grammar checkers', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'word processor', 'entity': 'Product'}]'

Example #8: The information retrieval metrics such as precision and recall or DCG are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'information retrieval', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'precision', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'recall', 'entity': 'Metrics'}, {'span': 'DCG', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #9: With long-time collaborator Laurent Cohen, a neurologist at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, Dehaene also identified patients with lesions in different regions of the parietal lobe with impaired multiplication, but preserved subtraction (associated with lesions of the inferior parietal lobule) and others with impaired subtraction, but preserved multiplication (associated with lesions to the intraparietal sulcus).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Laurent Cohen', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Dehaene', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'parietal lobe', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'inferior parietal lobule', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'intraparietal sulcus', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #10: A typical factory contains hundreds of industrial robot s working on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'industrial robot', 'entity': 'Product'}]'
