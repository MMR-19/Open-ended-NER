Example #1: He holds a D.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering (2000) from Inria and the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, and has held permanent positions at Siemens Corporate Technology, École des ponts ParisTech as well as visiting positions at Rutgers University, Yale University and University of Houston.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'D.Sc. degree', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'electrical and computer engineering', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Inria', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'University of Nice Sophia Antipolis', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Siemens Corporate Technology', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'École des ponts ParisTech', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Rutgers University', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Yale University', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Houston', 'entity': 'University'}]'

Example #2: Speech recognition and speech synthesis deal with how spoken language can be understood or created using computers.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Speech recognition', 'entity': 'Task'}, {'span': 'speech synthesis', 'entity': 'Task'}]'

Example #3: If the signal is further ergodic, all sample paths exhibits the same time-average and thus mathR _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) = \ widehat { R } _ x ^ { n / T _ 0 } (\ tau) / math in mean square error sense.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'mean square error', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #4: The Walt Disney Company also began more prominent use of 3D films in special venues to impress audiences with Magic Journeys (1982) and Captain EO (Francis Ford Coppola, 1986, starring Michael Jackson) being notable examples.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'The Walt Disney Company', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Magic Journeys', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Captain EO', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Francis Ford Coppola', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Michael Jackson', 'entity': 'Person'}]'

Example #5: Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Audio Engineering Society', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'audio signal', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'noise floor measurement', 'entity': 'Metrics'}]'

Example #6: The first palletizing robot was introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company. by KUKA robotics in Germany, and the Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly was invented by Victor Scheinman in 1976, and the design was sold to Unimation.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'palletizing robot', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company.', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'KUKA robotics', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Germany', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Programmable Universal Machine for Assembly', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'Victor Scheinman', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Unimation', 'entity': 'Organisation'}]'

Example #7: In the late 1980s, two Netherlands universities, University of Groningen and University of Twente, jointly began a project called Knowledge Graphs, which are semantic networks but with the added constraint that edges are restricted to be from a limited set of possible relations, to facilitate algebras on the graph.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Netherlands', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'University of Groningen', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'University of Twente', 'entity': 'University'}, {'span': 'Knowledge Graphs', 'entity': 'Product'}, {'span': 'semantic networks', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #8: The sigmoid function s and derivatives used in the package were originally included in the package, from version 0.8.0 onwards, these were released in a separate R package sigmoid, with the intention to enable more general use.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'sigmoid function', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'R', 'entity': 'Programming Language'}, {'span': 'sigmoid', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}]'

Example #9: With long-time collaborator Laurent Cohen, a neurologist at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, Dehaene also identified patients with lesions in different regions of the parietal lobe with impaired multiplication, but preserved subtraction (associated with lesions of the inferior parietal lobule) and others with impaired subtraction, but preserved multiplication (associated with lesions to the intraparietal sulcus).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Laurent Cohen', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital', 'entity': 'Organisation'}, {'span': 'Paris', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Dehaene', 'entity': 'Researcher'}, {'span': 'parietal lobe', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'inferior parietal lobule', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'intraparietal sulcus', 'entity': 'Misc'}]'

Example #10: Heterodyning is a signal processing technique invented by Canadian inventor-engineer Reginald Fessenden that creates new frequencies by combining mixing two frequencies.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Heterodyning', 'entity': 'Algorithm'}, {'span': 'signal processing', 'entity': 'Field'}, {'span': 'Canadian', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Reginald Fessenden', 'entity': 'Researcher'}]'
