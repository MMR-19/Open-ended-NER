Example #1: The Board determined that S. Leland Dill qualifies as ACFE and is independent (as each item defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'S. Leland Dill', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Form N-CSR', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #2: In considering a candidate s qualifications, each candidate must meet certain basic requirements, including relevant skills and experience, time availability and, if qualifying as an Independent Board Member candidate, independence from the Adviser or other service providers.
Expected output: 'entities: []'
