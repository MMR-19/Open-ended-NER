Example #2: Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, Independent Board Members of the Participating Funds may defer receipt of all, or a portion, of the compensation they earn for their services to the Participating Funds, in lieu of receiving current payments of such compensation.
Expected output: 'entities: []'
