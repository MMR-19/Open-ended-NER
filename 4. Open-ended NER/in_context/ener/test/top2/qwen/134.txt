Example #1: In January 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-01, Receivables (Topic 310): Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No. The amendments in this Update temporarily delay the effective date of the disclosures about troubled debt restructurings in Update 2010-20, enabling public-entity creditors to provide those disclosures after the FASB clarifies the guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'ASU', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'Receivables', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}, {'span': 'Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #2: Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, Independent Board Members of the Participating Funds may defer receipt of all, or a portion, of the compensation they earn for their services to the Participating Funds, in lieu of receiving current payments of such compensation.
Expected output: 'entities: []'
