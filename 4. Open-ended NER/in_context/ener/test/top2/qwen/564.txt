Example #1: In January 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-01, Receivables (Topic 310): Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No. The amendments in this Update temporarily delay the effective date of the disclosures about troubled debt restructurings in Update 2010-20, enabling public-entity creditors to provide those disclosures after the FASB clarifies the guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'ASU', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'Receivables', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}, {'span': 'Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #2: On October 31, 2003, the New York District Court entered a Final Judgment As To Defendant JPMSI (the “ JPMSI Research Analysts Final Judgment ”) that, among other things, enjoined JPMSI, directly or through its officers, directors, agents and employees, from violating then NASD Conduct Rules 2110, 2210, and 3010 and NYSE Rules 342, 401, 472, and 476 (the “ JPMSI Research Analysts Injunction ”).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'New York District Court', 'entity': 'Court'}, {'span': 'JPMSI', 'entity': 'Business'}, {'span': 'JPMSI Research Analysts Final Judgment', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}, {'span': 'NASD Conduct Rules', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'NYSE Rules', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'JPMSI Research Analysts Injunction', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'
