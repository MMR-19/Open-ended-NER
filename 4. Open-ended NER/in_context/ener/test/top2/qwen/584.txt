Example #1: In January 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-01, Receivables (Topic 310): Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No. The amendments in this Update temporarily delay the effective date of the disclosures about troubled debt restructurings in Update 2010-20, enabling public-entity creditors to provide those disclosures after the FASB clarifies the guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'ASU', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'Receivables', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}, {'span': 'Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #2: In October, 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-26, Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'ASU', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'
