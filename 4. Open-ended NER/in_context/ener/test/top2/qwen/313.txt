Example #1: The Board determined that S. Leland Dill qualifies as ACFE and is independent (as each item defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'S. Leland Dill', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Form N-CSR', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #2: Kelly to timely file said forms 3 and 4 was inadvertent.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Kelly', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'forms 3 and 4', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'
