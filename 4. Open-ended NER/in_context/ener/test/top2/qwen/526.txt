Example #1: Pursuant to the organizational documents of each Massachusetts Business Trust, each Board is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, to be elected by the holders of the outstanding Common Shares and any outstanding Preferred Shares, voting together as a single class to serve until the third succeeding annual meeting subsequent to their election or thereafter, in each case until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Massachusetts', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: The Board Members elected by holders of Preferred Shares will be elected to serve until the next annual meeting or until their successors have been duly elected and qualified.
Expected output: 'entities: []'
