Example #1: The Board determined that S. Leland Dill qualifies as ACFE and is independent (as each item defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'S. Leland Dill', 'entity': 'Person'}, {'span': 'Form N-CSR', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #2: The inspectors of election will determine whether or not a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting.
Expected output: 'entities: []'
