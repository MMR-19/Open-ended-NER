Example #1: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'accounting principles generally accepted', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'United States of America', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: In its oversight capacity, the committee reviews each Fund s annual financial statements with both management and the independent registered public accounting firm and the committee meets periodically with the independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors to consider their evaluation of each Fund s financial and internal controls.
Expected output: 'entities: []'
