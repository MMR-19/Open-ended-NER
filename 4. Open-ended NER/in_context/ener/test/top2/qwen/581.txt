Example #1: In January 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-01, Receivables (Topic 310): Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No. The amendments in this Update temporarily delay the effective date of the disclosures about troubled debt restructurings in Update 2010-20, enabling public-entity creditors to provide those disclosures after the FASB clarifies the guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'ASU', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'Receivables', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}, {'span': 'Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #2: In September 2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 201025, Plan Accounting Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962), Reporting Loans to Participants by Defined Contribution Pension Plans, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (Update).
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'Accounting Standards Update', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'ASU', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'Plan Accounting Defined Contribution Pension Plans (Topic 962), Reporting Loans to Participants by Defined Contribution Pension Plans', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}, {'span': 'FASB Emerging Issues Task Force', 'entity': 'Government'}]'
