Example #1: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) has become the exclusive reference of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Financial Accounting Standards Board', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'Accounting Standards Codification', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'ASC', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'U.S.', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'generally accepted accounting principles', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'GAAP', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}]'

Example #2: The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) has become the exclusive reference of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Financial Accounting Standards Board', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'Accounting Standards Codification', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'ASC', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'U.S.', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'generally accepted accounting principles', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'GAAP', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}]'

Example #3: In April 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-02, Receivables (Topic 310): A Creditor ’ s Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'ASU', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'Receivables', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}, {'span': 'A Creditor ’ s Determination of Whether a Restructuring Is a Troubled Debt Restructuring', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #4: In January 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-01, Receivables (Topic 310): Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings in Update No. The amendments in this Update temporarily delay the effective date of the disclosures about troubled debt restructurings in Update 2010-20, enabling public-entity creditors to provide those disclosures after the FASB clarifies the guidance for determining what constitutes a troubled debt restructuring.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'FASB', 'entity': 'Government'}, {'span': 'ASU', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'Receivables', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}, {'span': 'Deferral of the Effective Date of Disclosures about Troubled Debt Restructurings', 'entity': 'Miscellaneous'}]'

Example #5: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'accounting principles generally accepted', 'entity': 'Legislation/Act'}, {'span': 'United States of America', 'entity': 'Location'}]'
