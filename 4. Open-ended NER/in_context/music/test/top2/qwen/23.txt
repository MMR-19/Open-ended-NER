Example #1: The mid 2000s, especially the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, saw the continued longevity of nineties boy bands such as Backstreet Boys and Westlife (before they disbanded in 2012), and the successful comeback of Take That in 2005, Boyzone in 2007, and New Kids on the Block in 2008.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'United Kingdom', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Europe', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Backstreet Boys', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Westlife', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Take That', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Boyzone', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'New Kids on the Block', 'entity': 'Band'}]'

Example #2: In 2018, Buckingham was fired from the band and was replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Buckingham', 'entity': 'Musical Artist'}, {'span': 'Mike Campbell', 'entity': 'Musical Artist'}, {'span': 'Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Neil Finn', 'entity': 'Musical Artist'}, {'span': 'Split Enz', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Crowded House', 'entity': 'Band'}]'
