Example #1: The mid 2000s, especially the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe, saw the continued longevity of nineties boy bands such as Backstreet Boys and Westlife (before they disbanded in 2012), and the successful comeback of Take That in 2005, Boyzone in 2007, and New Kids on the Block in 2008.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'United Kingdom', 'entity': 'Country'}, {'span': 'Europe', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Backstreet Boys', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Westlife', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Take That', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Boyzone', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'New Kids on the Block', 'entity': 'Band'}]'

Example #2: However, some bands were created around the talent of a songwriter within the group like Gary Barlow of Take That or Tony Mortimer of East 17.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Gary Barlow', 'entity': 'Musical Artist'}, {'span': 'Take That', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Tony Mortimer', 'entity': 'Musical Artist'}, {'span': 'East 17', 'entity': 'Band'}]'
