Example #1: In addition, a vintage siren, just as the original Boston Garden had used, was added to replace the end-of-period horn for hockey only, a feature of the Montreal Canadiens, the Bruins ' arch-rivals, at the Montreal Forum (now the Pepsi Forum shopping centre) and the current Bell Centre.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Boston Garden', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Montreal Canadiens', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Bruins', 'entity': 'Misc'}, {'span': 'Montreal Forum', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Pepsi Forum', 'entity': 'Location'}, {'span': 'Bell Centre', 'entity': 'Location'}]'

Example #2: Bands sponsored by factories include The Black Dyke Mills Band, Yorkshire Imperial Band (originally the Yorkshire Copperworks Band), Foden's sponsored by the truck manufacturer, Fairey Band sponsored by the aircraft manufacturer, and Leyland Band sponsored by the vehicle manufacturer.
Expected output: 'entities: [{'span': 'Black Dyke Mills Band', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Yorkshire Imperial Band', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Yorkshire Copperworks Band', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': "Foden's", 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Fairey Band', 'entity': 'Band'}, {'span': 'Leyland Band', 'entity': 'Band'}]'
